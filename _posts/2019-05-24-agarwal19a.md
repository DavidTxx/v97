abstract: Dynamic neural networks are becoming increasingly common, and yet it is
  hard to implement them efficiently. On-the-fly operation batching for such models
  is sub-optimal and suffers from run time overheads, while writing manually batched
  versions can be hard and error-prone. To address this we extend TensorFlow with
  pfor, a parallel-for loop optimized using static loop vectorization. With pfor,
  users can express computation using nested loops and conditional constructs, but
  get performance resembling that of a manually batched version. Benchmarks demonstrate
  speedups of one to two orders of magnitude on range of tasks, from jacobian computation,
  to Graph Neural Networks.
