abstract: This paper presents gradKCCA, a large-scale sparse non-linear canonical
  correlation method. Like Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA), our method
  finds non-linear relations through kernel functions, but it does not rely on a kernel
  matrix, a known bottleneck for scaling up kernel methods. gradKCCA corresponds to
  solving KCCA with the additional constraint that the canonical projection directions
  in the kernel-induced feature space have preimages in the original data space. Firstly,
  this modification allows us to very efficiently maximize kernel canonical correlation
  through an alternating projected gradient algorithm working in the original data
  space. Secondly, we can control the sparsity of the projection directions by constraining
  the $\ell_1$ norm of the preimages of the projection directions, facilitating the
  interpretation of the discovered patterns, which is not available through KCCA.
  Our empirical experiments demonstrate that gradKCCA outperforms state-of-the-art
  CCA methods in terms of speed and robustness to noise both in simulated and real-world
  datasets.
