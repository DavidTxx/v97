abstract: Non-concave maximization has been the subject of much recent study in the
  optimization and machine learning communities, specifically in deep learning. Recent
  papers ([Ge et al. 2015, Lee et al 2017] and references therein) indicate that first
  order methods work well and avoid saddles points. Results as in [Lee \etal 2017],
  however, are limited to the <em>unconstrained</em> case or for cases where the critical
  points are in the interior of the feasibility set, which fail to capture some of
  the most interesting applications. In this paper we focus on <em>constrained</em>
  non-concave maximization. We analyze a variant of a well-established algorithm in
  machine learning called Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) for the maximization
  problem $\max_{\mathbf{x} \in D} P(\mathbf{x})$, where $P$ is non-concave, twice
  continuously differentiable and $D$ is a product of simplices. We show that MWU
  converges almost always for small enough stepsizes to critical points that satisfy
  the second order KKT conditions, by combining techniques from dynamical systems
  as well as taking advantage of a recent connection between Baum Eagon inequality
  and MWU [Palaiopanos et al 2017].
