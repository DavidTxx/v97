abstract: Kernel methods generalize machine learning algorithms that only depend on
  the pairwise inner products of the dataset by replacing inner products with kernel
  evaluations, a function that passes input points through a nonlinear feature map
  before taking the inner product in a higher dimensional space. In this work, we
  present nearly tight lower bounds on the number of kernel evaluations required to
  approximately solve kernel ridge regression (KRR) and kernel $k$-means clustering
  (KKMC) on $n$ input points. For KRR, our bound for relative error approximation
  the argmin of the objective function is $\Omega(nd_{\mathrm{eff}}^\lambda/\varepsilon)$
  where $d_{\mathrm{eff}}^\lambda$ is the effective statistical dimension, tight up
  to a $\log(d_{\mathrm{eff}}^\lambda/\varepsilon)$ factor. For KKMC, our bound for
  finding a $k$-clustering achieving a relative error approximation of the objective
  function is $\Omega(nk/\varepsilon)$, tight up to a $\log(k/\varepsilon)$ factor.
  Our KRR result resolves a variant of an open question of El Alaoui and Mahoney,
  asking whether the effective statistical dimension is a lower bound on the sampling
  complexity or not. Furthermore, for the important input distribution case of mixtures
  of Gaussians, we provide algorithms that bypass the above lower bounds.
