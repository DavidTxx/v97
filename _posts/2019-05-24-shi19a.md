abstract: Inference in Gaussian process (GP) models is computationally challenging
  for large data, and often difficult to approximate with a small number of inducing
  points. We explore an alternative approximation that employs stochastic inference
  networks for a flexible inference. Unfortunately, for such networks, minibatch training
  is difficult to be able to learn meaningful correlations over function outputs for
  a large dataset. We propose an algorithm that enables such training by tracking
  a stochastic, functional mirror-descent algorithm. At each iteration, this only
  requires considering a finite number of input locations, resulting in a scalable
  and easy-to-implement algorithm. Empirical results show comparable and, sometimes,
  superior performance to existing sparse variational GP methods.
