abstract: In this paper, we develop a new variant of k-means++ seeding that in expectation
  achieves a constant approximation guarantee. We obtain this result by a simple combination
  of k-means++ sampling with a local search strategy. We evaluate our algorithm empirically
  and show that it also improves the quality of a solution in practice.
