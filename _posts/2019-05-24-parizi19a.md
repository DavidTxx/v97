abstract: Non-convex optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning. Majorization-Minimization
  (MM) is a powerful iterative procedure for optimizing non-convex functions that
  works by optimizing a sequence of bounds on the function. In MM, the bound at each
  iteration is required to touch the objective function at the optimizer of the previous
  bound. We show that this touching constraint is unnecessary and overly restrictive.
  We generalize MM by relaxing this constraint, and propose a new optimization framework,
  named Generalized Majorization-Minimization (G-MM), that is more flexible. For instance,
  G-MM can incorporate application-specific biases into the optimization procedure
  without changing the objective function. We derive G-MM algorithms for several latent
  variable models and show empirically that they consistently outperform their MM
  counterparts in optimizing non-convex objectives. In particular, G-MM algorithms
  appear to be less sensitive to initialization.
