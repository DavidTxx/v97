abstract: Finding a dataset of minimal cardinality to characterize the optimal parameters
  of a model is of paramount importance in machine learning and distributed optimization
  over a network. This paper investigates the compressibility of large datasets. More
  specifically, we propose a framework that jointly learns the input-output mapping
  as well as the most representative samples of the dataset (sufficient dataset).
  Our analytical results show that the cardinality of the sufficient dataset increases
  sub-linearly with respect to the original dataset size. Numerical evaluations of
  real datasets reveal a large compressibility, up to 95%, without a noticeable drop
  in the learnability performance, measured by the generalization error.
