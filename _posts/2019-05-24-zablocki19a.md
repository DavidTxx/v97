abstract: Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims at classifying unlabeled objects by leveraging
  auxiliary knowledge, such as semantic representations. A limitation of previous
  approaches is that only intrinsic properties of objects, e.g. their visual appearance,
  are taken into account while their context, e.g. the surrounding objects in the
  image, is ignored. Following the intuitive principle that objects tend to be found
  in certain contexts but not others, we propose a new and challenging approach, context-aware
  ZSL, that leverages semantic representations in a new way to model the conditional
  likelihood of an object to appear in a given context. Finally, through extensive
  experiments conducted on Visual Genome, we show that contextual information can
  substantially improve the standard ZSL approach and is robust to unbalanced classes.
