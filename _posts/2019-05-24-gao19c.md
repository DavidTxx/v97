abstract: The enormous size of modern deep neural net-works makes it challenging to
  deploy those models in memory and communication limited scenarios. Thus, compressing
  a trained model without a significant loss in performance has become an increasingly
  important task. Tremendous advances has been made recently, where the main technical
  building blocks are pruning, quantization, and low-rank factorization. In this paper,
  we propose principled approaches to improve upon the common heuristics used in those
  building blocks, by studying the fundamental limit for model compression via the
  rate distortion theory. We prove a lower bound for the rate distortion function
  for model compression and prove its achievability for linear models. Although this
  achievable compression scheme is intractable in practice, this analysis motivates
  a novel objective function for model compression, which can be used to improve classes
  of model compressor such as pruning or quantization. Theoretically, we prove that
  the proposed scheme is optimal for compressing one-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks.
  Empirically,we show that the proposed scheme improves upon the baseline in the compression-accuracy
  tradeoff.
