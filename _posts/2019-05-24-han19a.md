abstract: We consider the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
  video game AI, where the agents are located in a spatial grid-world environment
  and the number of agents varies both within and across episodes. The challenge is
  to flexibly control an arbitrary number of agents while achieving effective collaboration.
  Existing MARL methods usually suffer from the trade-off between these two considerations.
  To address the issue, we propose a novel architecture that learns a spatial joint
  representation of all the agents and outputs grid-wise actions. Each agent will
  be controlled independently by taking the action from the grid it occupies. By viewing
  the state information as a grid feature map, we employ a convolutional encoder-decoder
  as the policy network. This architecture naturally promotes agent communication
  because of the large receptive field provided by the stacked convolutional layers.
  Moreover, the spatially shared convolutional parameters enable fast parallel exploration
  that the experiences discovered by one agent can be immediately transferred to others.
  The proposed method can be conveniently integrated with general reinforcement learning
  algorithms, e.g., PPO and Q-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  method in extensive challenging multi-agent tasks in StarCraft II.
