abstract: We propose a new point of view for regularizing deep neural networks by
  using the norm of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Even though this norm
  cannot be computed, it admits upper and lower approximations leading to various
  practical strategies. Specifically, this perspective (i) provides a common umbrella
  for many existing regularization principles, including spectral norm and gradient
  penalties, or adversarial training, (ii) leads to new effective regularization penalties,
  and (iii) suggests hybrid strategies combining lower and upper bounds to get better
  approximations of the RKHS norm. We experimentally show this approach to be effective
  when learning on small datasets, or to obtain adversarially robust models.
