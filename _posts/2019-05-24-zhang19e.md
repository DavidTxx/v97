abstract: We present Circuit-GNN, a graph neural network (GNN) model for designing
  distributed circuits. Today, designing distributed circuits is a slow process that
  can take months from an expert engineer. Our model both automates and speeds up
  the process. The model learns to simulate the electromagnetic (EM) properties of
  distributed circuits. Hence, it can be used to replace traditional EM simulators,
  which typically take tens of minutes for each design iteration. Further, by leveraging
  neural networks’ differentiability, we can use our model to solve the inverse problem
  – i.e., given desirable EM specifications, we propagate the gradient to optimize
  the circuit parameters and topology to satisfy the specifications. We exploit the
  flexibility of GNN to create one model that works for different circuit topologies.
  We compare our model with a commercial simulator showing that it reduces simulation
  time by four orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate the value of our model by
  using it to design a Terahertz channelizer, a difficult task that requires a specialized
  expert. The results show that our model produces a channelizer whose performance
  is as good as a manually optimized design, and can save the expert several weeks
  of topology and parameter optimization. Most interestingly, our model comes up with
  new designs that differ from the limited templates commonly used by engineers in
  the field, hence significantly expanding the design space.
