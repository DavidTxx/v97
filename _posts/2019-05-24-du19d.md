abstract: We consider the problem of nonparametric regression in the high-dimensional
  setting in which $P \gg N$. We study the use of overlapping group structures to
  improve prediction and variable selection. These structures arise commonly when
  analyzing DNA microarray data, where genes can naturally be grouped according to
  genetic pathways. We incorporate overlapping group structure into a Bayesian additive
  regression trees model using a prior constructed so that, if a variable from some
  group is used to construct a split, this increases the probability that subsequent
  splits will use predictors from the same group. We refer to our model as an overlapping
  group Bayesian additive regression trees (OG-BART) model, and our prior on the splits
  an overlapping group Dirichlet (OG-Dirichlet) prior. Like the sparse group lasso,
  our prior encourages sparsity both within and between groups. We study the correlation
  structure of the prior, illustrate the proposed methodology on simulated data, and
  apply the methodology to gene expression data to learn which genetic pathways are
  predictive of breast cancer tumor metastasis.
