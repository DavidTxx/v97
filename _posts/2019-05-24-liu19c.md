abstract: We wish to compute the gradient of an expectation over a finite or countably
  infinite sample space having K $\leq$ $\infty$ categories. When K is indeed infinite,
  or finite but very large, the relevant summation is intractable. Accordingly, various
  stochastic gradient estimators have been proposed. In this paper, we describe a
  technique that can be applied to reduce the variance of any such estimator, without
  changing its bias{â€”}in particular, unbiasedness is retained. We show that our technique
  is an instance of Rao-Blackwellization, and we demonstrate the improvement it yields
  on a semi-supervised classification problem and a pixel attention task.
