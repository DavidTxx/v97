abstract: We show how to turn any classifier that classifies well under Gaussian noise
  into a new classifier that is certifiably robust to adversarial perturbations under
  the L2 norm. While this "randomized smoothing" technique has been proposed before
  in the literature, we are the first to provide a tight analysis, which establishes
  a close connection between L2 robustness and Gaussian noise. We use the technique
  to train an ImageNet classifier with e.g. a certified top-1 accuracy of 49% under
  adversarial perturbations with L2 norm less than 0.5 (=127/255). Smoothing is the
  only approach to certifiably robust classification which has been shown feasible
  on full-resolution ImageNet. On smaller-scale datasets where competing approaches
  to certified L2 robustness are viable, smoothing delivers higher certified accuracies.
  The empirical success of the approach suggests that provable methods based on randomization
  at prediction time are a promising direction for future research into adversarially
  robust classification.
