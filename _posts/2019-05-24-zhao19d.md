abstract: In Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning, an agent learns to achieve multiple
  goals with a goal-conditioned policy. During learning, the agent first collects
  the trajectories into a replay buffer, and later these trajectories are selected
  randomly for replay. However, the achieved goals in the replay buffer are often
  biased towards the behavior policies. From a Bayesian perspective, when there is
  no prior knowledge about the target goal distribution, the agent should learn uniformly
  from diverse achieved goals. Therefore, we first propose a novel multi-goal RL objective
  based on weighted entropy. This objective encourages the agent to maximize the expected
  return, as well as to achieve more diverse goals. Secondly, we developed a maximum
  entropy-based prioritization framework to optimize the proposed objective. For evaluation
  of this framework, we combine it with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, both with
  or without Hindsight Experience Replay. On a set of multi-goal robotic tasks of
  OpenAI Gym, we compare our method with other baselines and show promising improvements
  in both performance and sample-efficiency.
