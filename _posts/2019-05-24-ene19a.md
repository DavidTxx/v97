abstract: The iteratively reweighted least squares method (IRLS) is a popular technique
  used in practice for solving regression problems. Various versions of this method
  have been proposed, but their theoretical analyses failed to capture the good practical
  performance. In this paper we propose a simple and natural version of IRLS for solving
  $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_1$ regression, which provably converges to a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
  solution in $O(m^{1/3}\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^{2/3} + \log m/\epsilon^2)$ iterations,
  where $m$ is the number of rows of the input matrix. Interestingly, this running
  time is independent of the conditioning of the input, and the dominant term of the
  running time depends sublinearly in $\epsilon^{-1}$, which is atypical for the optimization
  of non-smooth functions. This improves upon the more complex algorithms of Chin
  et al. (ITCS ’12), and Christiano et al. (STOC ’11) by a factor of at least $1/\epsilon^2$,
  and yields a truly efficient natural algorithm for the slime mold dynamics (Straszak-Vishnoi,
  SODA ’16, ITCS ’16, ITCS ’17).
