abstract: Kernel methods are effective but do not scale well to large scale data,
  especially in high dimensions where the geometric data structures used to accelerate
  kernel evaluation suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Recent theoretical advances
  have proposed fast kernel evaluation algorithms leveraging hashing techniques with
  worst-case asymptotic improvements. However, these advances are largely confined
  to the theoretical realm due to concerns such as super-linear preprocessing time
  and diminishing gains in non-worst case datasets. In this paper, we close the gap
  between theory and practice by addressing these challenges via provable and practical
  procedures for adaptive sample size selection, preprocessing time reduction, and
  refined variance bounds that quantify the data-dependent performance of random sampling
  and hashing-based kernel evaluation methods. Our experiments show that these new
  tools offer up to $10\times$ improvement in evaluation time on a range of synthetic
  and real-world datasets.
