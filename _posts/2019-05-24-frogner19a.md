abstract: Across the social sciences and elsewhere, practitioners frequently have
  to reason about relationships between random variables, despite lacking joint observations
  of the variables. This is sometimes called an "ecological" inference; given samples
  from the marginal distributions of the variables, one attempts to infer their joint
  distribution. The problem is inherently ill-posed, yet only a few models have been
  proposed for bringing prior information into the problem, often relying on restrictive
  or unrealistic assumptions and lacking a unified approach. In this paper, we treat
  the inference problem generally and propose a unified class of models that encompasses
  some of those previously proposed while including many new ones. Previous work has
  relied on either relaxation or approximate inference via MCMC, with the latter known
  to mix prohibitively slowly for this type of problem. Here we instead give a single
  exact inference algorithm that works for the entire model class via an efficient
  fixed point iteration called Dykstraâ€™s method. We investigate empirically both the
  computational cost of our algorithm and the accuracy of the new models on real datasets,
  showing favorable performance in both cases and illustrating the impact of increased
  flexibility in modeling enabled by this work.
