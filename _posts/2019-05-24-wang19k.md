abstract: Producing probabilistic forecasts for large collections of similar and/or
  dependent time series is a practically highly relevant, yet challenging task. Classical
  time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data and multivariate
  techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes, but their reliance on strong
  structural assumptions makes them data-efficient and allows them to provide estimates
  of uncertainty. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which
  can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we
  propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new
  method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also
  handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical
  and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and
  sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part
  and extensive experiments. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model
  both in term of data efficiency and computational complexity.
