abstract: Stochastic optimization algorithms update models with cheap per-iteration
  costs sequentially, which makes them amenable for large-scale data analysis. Such
  algorithms have been widely studied for structured sparse models where the sparsity
  information is very specific, e.g., convex sparsity-inducing norms or $\ell^0$-norm.
  However, these norms cannot be directly applied to the problem of complex (non-convex)
  graph-structured sparsity models, which have important application in disease outbreak
  and social networks, etc. In this paper, we propose a stochastic gradient-based
  method for solving graph-structured sparsity constraint problems, not restricted
  to the least square loss. We prove that our algorithm enjoys a linear convergence
  up to a constant error, which is competitive with the counterparts in the batch
  learning setting. We conduct extensive experiments to show the efficiency and effectiveness
  of the proposed algorithms.
