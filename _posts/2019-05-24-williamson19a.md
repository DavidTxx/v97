abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are non-discriminatory or fair with respect to
  a sensitive feature (e.g., race or gender) is a topical problem. Progress in this
  task requires fixing a definition of fairness, and there have been several proposals
  in this regard over the past few years. Several of these, however, assume either
  binary sensitive features (thus precluding categorical or real-valued sensitive
  groups), or result in non-convex objectives (thus adversely affecting the optimisation
  landscape). In this paper, we propose a new definition of fairness that generalises
  some existing proposals, while allowing for generic sensitive features and resulting
  in a convex objective. The key idea is to enforce that the expected losses (or risks)
  across each subgroup induced by the sensitive feature are commensurate. We show
  how this relates to the rich literature on risk measures from mathematical finance.
  As a special case, this leads to a new convex fairness-aware objective based on
  minimising the conditional value at risk (CVaR).
