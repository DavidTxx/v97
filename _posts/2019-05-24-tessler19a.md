abstract: A policy is said to be robust if it maximizes the reward while considering
  a bad, or even adversarial, model. In this work we formalize two new criteria of
  robustness to action uncertainty. Specifically, we consider two scenarios in which
  the agent attempts to perform an action $\action$, and (i) with probability $\alpha$,
  an alternative adversarial action $\bar \action$ is taken, or (ii) an adversary
  adds a perturbation to the selected action in the case of continuous action space.
  We show that our criteria are related to common forms of uncertainty in robotics
  domains, such as the occurrence of abrupt forces, and suggest algorithms in the
  tabular case. Building on the suggested algorithms, we generalize our approach to
  deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and provide extensive experiments in the various
  MuJoCo domains. Our experiments show that not only does our approach produce robust
  policies, but it also improves the performance in the absence of perturbations.
  This generalization indicates that action-robustness can be thought of as implicit
  regularization in RL problems.
