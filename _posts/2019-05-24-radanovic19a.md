abstract: We consider a two-agent MDP framework where agents repeatedly solve a task
  in a collaborative setting. We study the problem of designing a learning algorithm
  for the first agent (A1) that facilitates a successful collaboration even in cases
  when the second agent (A2) is adapting its policy in an unknown way. The key challenge
  in our setting is that the first agent faces non-stationarity in rewards and transitions
  because of the adaptive behavior of the second agent. We design novel online learning
  algorithms for agent A1 whose regret decays as $O(T^{1-\frac{3}{7} \cdot \alpha})$
  with $T$ learning episodes provided that the magnitude of agent A2’s policy changes
  between any two consecutive episodes are upper bounded by $O(T^{-\alpha})$. Here,
  the parameter $\alpha$ is assumed to be strictly greater than $0$, and we show that
  this assumption is necessary provided that the <em>learning parity with noise</em>
  problem is computationally hard. We show that sub-linear regret of agent A1 further
  implies near-optimality of the agents’ joint return for MDPs that manifest the properties
  of a <em>smooth</em> game.
