abstract: Neural networks are known to be a class of highly expressive functions able
  to fit even random input-output mappings with 100% accuracy. In this work we present
  properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using
  tools from Fourier analysis, we highlight a learning bias of deep networks towards
  low frequency functions – i.e. functions that vary globally without local fluctuations
  – which manifests itself as a frequency-dependent learning speed. Intuitively, this
  property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks prioritize
  learning simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate
  the role of the shape of the data manifold by presenting empirical and theoretical
  evidence that, somewhat counter-intuitively, learning higher frequencies gets easier
  with increasing manifold complexity.
