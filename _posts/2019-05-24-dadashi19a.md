abstract: 'We establish geometric and topological properties of the space of value
  functions in finite state-action Markov decision processes. Our main contribution
  is the characterization of the nature of its shape: a general polytope (Aigner et
  al., 2010). To demonstrate this result, we exhibit several properties of the structural
  relationship between policies and value functions including the line theorem, which
  shows that the value functions of policies constrained on all but one state describe
  a line segment. Finally, we use this novel perspective and introduce visualizations
  to enhance the understanding of the dynamics of reinforcement learning algorithms.'
