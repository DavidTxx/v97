abstract: 'Knowledge distillation, i.e., one classifier being trained on the outputs
  of another classifier, is an empirically very successful technique for knowledge
  transfer between classifiers. It has even been observed that classifiers learn much
  faster and more reliably if trained with the outputs of another classifier as soft
  labels, instead of from ground truth data. So far, however, there is no satisfactory
  theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. In this work, we provide the first insights
  into the working mechanisms of distillation by studying the special case of linear
  and deep linear classifiers. Specifically, we prove a generalization bound that
  establishes fast convergence of the expected risk of a distillation-trained linear
  classifier. From the bound and its proof we extract three key factors that determine
  the success of distillation: * data geometry – geometric properties of the data
  distribution, in particular class separation, has a direct influence on the convergence
  speed of the risk; * optimization bias – gradient descent optimization finds a very
  favorable minimum of the distillation objective; and * strong monotonicity – the
  expected risk of the student classifier always decreases when the size of the training
  set grows.'
