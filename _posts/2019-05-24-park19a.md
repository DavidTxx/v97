abstract: 'Variational autoencoders employ an amortized inference model to approximate
  the posterior of latent variables. However, such amortized variational inference
  faces two challenges: (1) the limited posterior expressiveness of fully-factorized
  Gaussian assumption and (2) the amortization error of the inference model. We present
  a novel approach that addresses both challenges. First, we focus on ReLU networks
  with Gaussian output and illustrate their connection to probabilistic PCA. Building
  on this observation, we derive an iterative algorithm that finds the mode of the
  posterior and apply fullcovariance Gaussian posterior approximation centered on
  the mode. Subsequently, we present a general framework named Variational Laplace
  Autoencoders (VLAEs) for training deep generative models. Based on the Laplace approximation
  of the latent variable posterior, VLAEs enhance the expressiveness of the posterior
  while reducing the amortization error. Empirical results on MNIST, Omniglot, Fashion-MNIST,
  SVHN and CIFAR10 show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other
  recent amortized or iterative methods on the ReLU networks.'
