abstract: We consider the problem of selective prediction (also known as reject option)
  in deep neural networks, and introduce SelectiveNet, a deep neural architecture
  with an integrated reject option. Existing rejection mechanisms are based mostly
  on a threshold over the prediction confidence of a pre-trained network. In contrast,
  SelectiveNet is trained to optimize both classification (or regression) and rejection
  simultaneously, end-to-end. The result is a deep neural network that is optimized
  over the covered domain. In our experiments, we show a consistently improved risk-coverage
  trade-off over several well-known classification and regression datasets, thus reaching
  new state-of-the-art results for deep selective classification.
