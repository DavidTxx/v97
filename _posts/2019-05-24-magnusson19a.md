abstract: Model inference, such as model comparison, model checking, and model selection,
  is an important part of model development. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO)
  is a general approach for assessing the generalizability of a model, but unfortunately,
  LOO does not scale well to large datasets. We propose a combination of using approximate
  inference techniques and probability-proportional-to-size-sampling (PPS) for fast
  LOO model evaluation for large datasets. We provide both theoretical and empirical
  results showing good properties for large data.
