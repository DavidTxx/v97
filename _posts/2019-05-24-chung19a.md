abstract: We consider the problem of detecting the presence of the signal in a rank-one
  signal-plus-noise data matrix. In case the signal-to-noise ratio is under the threshold
  below which a reliable detection is impossible, we propose a hypothesis test based
  on the linear spectral statistics of the data matrix. When the noise is Gaussian,
  the error of the proposed test is optimal as it matches the error of the likelihood
  ratio test that minimizes the sum of the Type-I and Type-II errors. The test is
  data-driven and does not depend on the distribution of the signal or the noise.
  If the density of the noise is known, it can be further improved by an entrywise
  transformation to lower the error of the test.
