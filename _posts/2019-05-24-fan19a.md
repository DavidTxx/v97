abstract: We introduce multi-frequency vector diffusion maps (MFVDM), a new framework
  for organizing and analyzing high dimensional data sets. The new method is a mathematical
  and algorithmic generalization of vector diffusion maps (VDM) and other non-linear
  dimensionality reduction methods. The idea of MFVDM is to incorporates multiple
  unitary irreducible representations of the alignment group which introduces robustness
  to noise. We illustrate the efficacy of MFVDM on synthetic and cryo-EM image datasets,
  achieving better nearest neighbors search and alignment estimation than other baselines
  as VDM and diffusion maps (DM), especially on extremely noisy data.
