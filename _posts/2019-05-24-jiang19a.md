abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved significant breakthroughs
  in various tasks. However, most DRL algorithms suffer a problem of generalising
  the learned policy, which makes the policy performance largely affected even by
  minor modifications of the training environment. Except that, the use of deep neural
  networks makes the learned policies hard to be interpretable. To address these two
  challenges, we propose a novel algorithm named Neural Logic Reinforcement Learning
  (NLRL) to represent the policies in reinforcement learning by first-order logic.
  NLRL is based on policy gradient methods and differentiable inductive logic programming
  that have demonstrated significant advantages in terms of interpretability and generalisability
  in supervised tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on cliff-walking and blocks
  manipulation tasks demonstrate that NLRL can induce interpretable policies achieving
  near-optimal performance while showing good generalisability to environments of
  different initial states and problem sizes.
