abstract: For text analysis, one often resorts to a lossy representation that either
  completely ignores word order or embeds each word as a low-dimensional dense feature
  vector. In this paper, we propose convolutional Poisson factor analysis (CPFA) that
  directly operates on a lossless representation that processes the words in each
  document as a sequence of high-dimensional one-hot vectors. To boost its performance,
  we further propose the convolutional Poisson gamma belief network (CPGBN) that couples
  CPFA with the gamma belief network via a novel probabilistic pooling layer. CPFA
  forms words into phrases and captures very specific phrase-level topics, and CPGBN
  further builds a hierarchy of increasingly more general phrase-level topics. For
  efficient inference, we develop both a Gibbs sampler and a Weibull distribution
  based convolutional variational auto-encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that
  CPGBN can extract high-quality text latent representations that capture the word
  order information, and hence can be leveraged as a building block to enrich a wide
  variety of existing latent variable models that ignore word order.
