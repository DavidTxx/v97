abstract: To be effective in sequential data processing, Recurrent Neural Networks
  (RNNs) are required to keep track of past events by creating memories. While the
  relation between memories and the network’s hidden state dynamics was established
  over the last decade, previous works in this direction were of a predominantly descriptive
  nature focusing mainly on locating the dynamical objects of interest. In particular,
  it remained unclear how dynamical observables affect the performance, how they form
  and whether they can be manipulated. Here, we utilize different training protocols,
  datasets and architectures to obtain a range of networks solving a delayed classification
  task with similar performance, alongside substantial differences in their ability
  to extrapolate for longer delays. We analyze the dynamics of the network’s hidden
  state, and uncover the reasons for this difference. Each memory is found to be associated
  with a nearly steady state of the dynamics which we refer to as a ’slow point’.
  Slow point speeds predict extrapolation performance across all datasets, protocols
  and architectures tested. Furthermore, by tracking the formation of the slow points
  we are able to understand the origin of differences between training protocols.
  Finally, we propose a novel regularization technique that is based on the relation
  between hidden state speeds and memory longevity. Our technique manipulates these
  speeds, thereby leading to a dramatic improvement in memory robustness over time,
  and could pave the way for a new class of regularization methods.
