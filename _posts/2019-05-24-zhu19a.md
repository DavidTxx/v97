abstract: In this paper, we explore clean-label poisoning attacks on deep convolutional
  networks with access to neither the networkâ€™s output nor its architecture or parameters.
  Our goal is to ensure that after injecting the poisons into the training data, a
  model with unknown architecture and parameters trained on that data will misclassify
  the target image into a specific class. To achieve this goal, we generate multiple
  poison images from the base class by adding small perturbations which cause the
  poison images to trap the target image within their convex polytope in feature space.
  We also demonstrate that using Dropout during crafting of the poisons and enforcing
  this objective in multiple layers enhances transferability, enabling attacks against
  both the transfer learning and end-to-end training settings. We demonstrate transferable
  attack success rates of over 50% by poisoning only 1% of the training set.
