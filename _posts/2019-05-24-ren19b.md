abstract: Variance reduction is crucial in stochastic estimation and optimization
  problems. Antithetic sampling reduces the variance of a Monte Carlo estimator by
  drawing correlated, rather than independent, samples. However, designing an effective
  correlation structure is challenging and application specific, thus limiting the
  practical applicability of these methods. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose
  adaptive antithetic sampling framework. We provide gradient-based and gradient-free
  methods to train the samplers such that they reduce variance while ensuring that
  the underlying Monte Carlo estimator is provably unbiased. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach on Bayesian inference and generative model training, where it reduces
  variance and improves task performance with little computational overhead.
