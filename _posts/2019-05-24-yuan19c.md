abstract: Recently, there has been a great deal of research attention on understanding
  the convergence behavior of first-order methods. One line of this research focuses
  on analyzing the convergence behavior of first-order methods using tools from continuous
  dynamical systems such as ordinary differential equations and differential inclusions.
  These research results shed lights on better understanding first-order methods from
  a non-optimization point of view. The alternating direction method of multipliers
  (ADMM) is a widely used first-order method for solving optimization problems arising
  from machine learning and statistics, and it is important to investigate its behavior
  using these new techniques from dynamical systems. Existing works along this line
  have been mainly focusing on problems with smooth objective functions, which exclude
  many important applications that are traditionally solved by ADMM variants. In this
  paper, we analyze some well-known and widely used ADMM variants for nonsmooth optimization
  problems using tools of differential inclusions. In particular, we analyze the convergence
  behavior of linearized ADMM, gradient-based ADMM, generalized ADMM and accelerated
  generalized ADMM for nonsmooth problems and show their connections with dynamical
  systems. We anticipate that these results will provide new insights on understanding
  ADMM for solving nonsmooth problems.
