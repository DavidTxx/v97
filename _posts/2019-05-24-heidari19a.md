abstract: 'Most existing notions of algorithmic fairness are one-shot: they ensure
  some form of allocative equality at the time of decision making, but do not account
  for the adverse impact of the algorithmic decisions today on the long-term welfare
  and prosperity of certain segments of the population. We take a broader perspective
  on algorithmic fairness. We propose an effort-based measure of fairness and present
  a data-driven framework for characterizing the long-term impact of algorithmic policies
  on reshaping the underlying population. Motivated by the psychological literature
  on social learning and the economic literature on equality of opportunity, we propose
  a micro-scale model of how individuals may respond to decision-making algorithms.
  We employ existing measures of segregation from sociology and economics to quantify
  the resulting macro- scale population-level change. Importantly, we observe that
  different models may shift the group- conditional distribution of qualifications
  in different directions. Our findings raise a number of important questions regarding
  the formalization of fairness for decision-making models.'
