abstract: Recent work has sought to understand the behavior of neural networks by
  comparing representations between layers and between different trained models. We
  examine methods for comparing neural network representations based on canonical
  correlation analysis (CCA). We show that CCA belongs to a family of statistics for
  measuring multivariate similarity, but that neither CCA nor any other statistic
  that is invariant to invertible linear transformation can measure meaningful similarities
  between representations of higher dimension than the number of data points. We introduce
  a similarity index that measures the relationship between representational similarity
  matrices and does not suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent
  to centered kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA. Unlike
  CCA, CKA can reliably identify correspondences between representations in networks
  trained from different initializations.
