abstract: We introduce the Metropolis-Hastings generative adversarial network (MH-GAN),
  which combines aspects of Markov chain Monte Carlo and GANs. The MH-GAN draws samples
  from the distribution implicitly defined by a GANâ€™s discriminator-generator pair,
  as opposed to standard GANs which draw samples from the distribution defined only
  by the generator. It uses the discriminator from GAN training to build a wrapper
  around the generator for improved sampling. With a perfect discriminator, this wrapped
  generator samples from the true distribution on the data exactly even when the generator
  is imperfect. We demonstrate the benefits of the improved generator on multiple
  benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and CelebA, using the DCGAN, WGAN, and progressive
  GAN.
