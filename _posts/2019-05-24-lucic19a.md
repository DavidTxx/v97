abstract: Deep generative models are becoming a cornerstone of modern machine learning.
  Recent work on conditional generative adversarial networks has shown that learning
  complex, high-dimensional distributions over natural images is within reach. While
  the latest models are able to generate high-fidelity, diverse natural images at
  high resolution, they rely on a vast quantity of labeled data. In this work we demonstrate
  how one can benefit from recent work on self- and semi-supervised learning to outperform
  the state of the art on both unsupervised ImageNet synthesis, as well as in the
  conditional setting. In particular, the proposed approach is able to match the sample
  quality (as measured by FID) of the current state-of-the-art conditional model BigGAN
  on ImageNet using only 10% of the labels and outperform it using 20% of the labels.
