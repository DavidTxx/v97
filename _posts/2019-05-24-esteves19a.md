abstract: 'Spherical convolutional networks have been introduced recently as tools
  to learn powerful feature representations of 3D shapes. Spherical CNNs are equivariant
  to 3D rotations making them ideally suited to applications where 3D data may be
  observed in arbitrary orientations. In this paper we learn 2D image embeddings with
  a similar equivariant structure: embedding the image of a 3D object should commute
  with rotations of the object. We introduce a cross-domain embedding from 2D images
  into a spherical CNN latent space. This embedding encodes images with 3D shape properties
  and is equivariant to 3D rotations of the observed object. The model is supervised
  only by target embeddings obtained from a spherical CNN pretrained for 3D shape
  classification. We show that learning a rich embedding for images with appropriate
  geometric structure is sufficient for tackling varied applications, such as relative
  pose estimation and novel view synthesis, without requiring additional task-specific
  supervision.'
