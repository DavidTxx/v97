abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are known to achieve the state-of-the-art
  performance on various generative tasks, but these results come at the expense of
  a notoriously difficult training phase. Current training strategies typically draw
  a connection to optimization theory, whose scope is restricted to local convergence
  due to the presence of non-convexity. In this work, we tackle the training of GANs
  by rethinking the problem formulation from the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) perspective.
  Via a classical lifting trick, we show that essentially all existing GAN objectives
  can be relaxed into their mixed strategy forms, whose global optima can be solved
  via sampling, in contrast to the exclusive use of optimization framework in previous
  work. We further propose a mean-approximation sampling scheme, which allows to systematically
  exploit methods for bi-affine games to delineate novel, practical training algorithms
  of GANs. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that our approach yields comparable
  or superior results to contemporary training algorithms, and outperforms classical
  methods such as SGD, Adam, and RMSProp.
