abstract: Noisy labels are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, which poses a challenge
  for robustly training deep neural networks (DNNs) as DNNs usually have the high
  capacity to memorize the noisy labels. In this paper, we find that the test accuracy
  can be quantitatively characterized in terms of the noise ratio in datasets. In
  particular, the test accuracy is a quadratic function of the noise ratio in the
  case of symmetric noise, which explains the experimental findings previously published.
  Based on our analysis, we apply cross-validation to randomly split noisy datasets,
  which identifies most samples that have correct labels. Then we adopt the Co-teaching
  strategy which takes full advantage of the identified samples to train DNNs robustly
  against noisy labels. Compared with extensive state-of-the-art methods, our strategy
  consistently improves the generalization performance of DNNs under both synthetic
  and real-world training noise.
