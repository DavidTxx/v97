abstract: Adaptive stochastic gradient algorithms in the Euclidean space have attracted
  much attention lately. Such explorations on Riemannian manifolds, on the other hand,
  are relatively new, limited, and challenging. This is because of the intrinsic non-linear
  structure of the underlying manifold and the absence of a canonical coordinate system.
  In machine learning applications, however, most manifolds of interest are represented
  as matrices with notions of row and column subspaces. In addition, the implicit
  manifold-related constraints may also lie on such subspaces. For example, the Grassmann
  manifold is the set of column subspaces. To this end, such a rich structure should
  not be lost by transforming matrices to just a stack of vectors while developing
  optimization algorithms on manifolds. We propose novel stochastic gradient algorithms
  for problems on Riemannian matrix manifolds by adapting the row and column subspaces
  of gradients. Our algorithms are provably convergent and they achieve the convergence
  rate of order $O(log(T)/sqrt(T))$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Our experiments
  illustrate that the proposed algorithms outperform existing Riemannian adaptive
  stochastic algorithms.
