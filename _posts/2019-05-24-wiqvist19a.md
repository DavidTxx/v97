abstract: We present a novel family of deep neural architectures, named partially
  exchangeable networks (PENs) that leverage probabilistic symmetries. By design,
  PENs are invariant to block-switch transformations, which characterize the partial
  exchangeability properties of conditionally Markovian processes. Moreover, we show
  that any block-switch invariant function has a PEN-like representation. The DeepSets
  architecture is a special case of PEN and we can therefore also target fully exchangeable
  data. We employ PENs to learn summary statistics in approximate Bayesian computation
  (ABC). When comparing PENs to previous deep learning methods for learning summary
  statistics, our results are highly competitive, both considering time series and
  static models. Indeed, PENs provide more reliable posterior samples even when using
  less training data.
