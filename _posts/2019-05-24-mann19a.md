abstract: 'Predicting delayed outcomes is an important problem in recommender systems
  (e.g., if customers will finish reading an ebook). We formalize the problem as an
  adversarial, delayed online learning problem and consider how a proxy for the delayed
  outcome (e.g., if customers read a third of the book in 24 hours) can help minimize
  regret, even though the proxy is not available when making a prediction. Motivated
  by our regret analysis, we propose two neural network architectures: Factored Forecaster
  (FF) which is ideal if the proxy is informative of the outcome in hindsight, and
  Residual Factored Forecaster (RFF) that is robust to a non-informative proxy. Experiments
  on two real-world datasets for predicting human behavior show that RFF outperforms
  both FF and a direct forecaster that does not make use of the proxy. Our results
  suggest that exploiting proxies by factorization is a promising way to mitigate
  the impact of long delays in human-behavior prediction tasks.'
