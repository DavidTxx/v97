abstract: Popular word embedding algorithms exhibit stereotypical biases, such as
  gender bias. The widespread use of these algorithms in machine learning systems
  can amplify stereotypes in important contexts. Although some methods have been developed
  to mitigate this problem, how word embedding biases arise during training is poorly
  understood. In this work we develop a technique to address this question. Given
  a word embedding, our method reveals how perturbing the training corpus would affect
  the resulting embedding bias. By tracing the origins of word embedding bias back
  to the original training documents, one can identify subsets of documents whose
  removal would most reduce bias. We demonstrate our methodology on Wikipedia and
  New York Times corpora, and find it to be very accurate.
