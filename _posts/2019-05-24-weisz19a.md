abstract: 'We consider the problem of configuring general-purpose solvers to run efficiently
  on problem instances drawn from an unknown distribution, a problem of major interest
  in solver autoconfiguration. Following previous work, we focus on designing algorithms
  that find a configuration with near-optimal expected capped runtime while doing
  the least amount of work, with the cap chosen in a configuration-specific way so
  that most instances are solved. In this paper we present a new algorithm, CapsAndRuns,
  which finds a near-optimal configuration while using time that scales (in a problem
  dependent way) with the optimal expected capped runtime, significantly strengthening
  previous results which could only guarantee a bound that scaled with the potentially
  much larger optimal expected uncapped runtime. The new algorithm is simpler and
  more intuitive than the previous methods: first it estimates the optimal runtime
  cap for each configuration, then it uses a Bernstein race to find a near optimal
  configuration given the caps. Experiments verify that our method can significantly
  outperform its competitors.'
