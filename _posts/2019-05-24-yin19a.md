abstract: We study robust distributed learning that involves minimizing a non-convex
  loss function with saddle points. We consider the Byzantine setting where some worker
  machines have abnormal or even arbitrary and adversarial behavior, and in this setting,
  the Byzantine machines may create fake local minima near a saddle point that is
  far away from any true local minimum, even when robust gradient estimators are used.
  We develop ByzantinePGD, a robust first-order algorithm that can provably escape
  saddle points and fake local minima, and converge to an approximate true local minimizer
  with low iteration complexity. As a by-product, we give a simpler algorithm and
  analysis for escaping saddle points in the usual non-Byzantine setting. We further
  discuss three robust gradient estimators that can be used in ByzantinePGD, including
  median, trimmed mean, and iterative filtering. We characterize their performance
  in concrete statistical settings, and argue for their near-optimality in low and
  high dimensional regimes.
