abstract: The bits-back argument suggests that latent variable models can be turned
  into lossless compression schemes. Translating the bits-back argument into efficient
  and practical lossless compression schemes for general latent variable models, however,
  is still an open problem. Bits-Back with Asymmetric Numeral Systems (BB-ANS), recently
  proposed by Townsend et al,. 2019, makes bits-back coding practically feasible for
  latent variable models with one latent layer, but it is inefficient for hierarchical
  latent variable models. In this paper we propose Bit-Swap, a new compression scheme
  that generalizes BB-ANS and achieves strictly better compression rates for hierarchical
  latent variable models with Markov chain structure. Through experiments we verify
  that Bit-Swap results in lossless compression rates that are empirically superior
  to existing techniques.
