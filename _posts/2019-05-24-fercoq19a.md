abstract: We propose a stochastic gradient framework for solving stochastic composite
  convex optimization problems with (possibly) infinite number of linear inclusion
  constraints that need to be satisfied almost surely. We use smoothing and homotopy
  techniques to handle constraints without the need for matrix-valued projections.
  We show for our stochastic gradient algorithm $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)/\sqrt{k})$ convergence
  rate for general convex objectives and $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)/k)$ convergence rate
  for restricted strongly convex objectives. These rates are known to be optimal up
  to logarithmic factor, even without constraints. We conduct numerical experiments
  on basis pursuit, hard margin support vector machines and portfolio optimization
  problems and show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art practical performance.
