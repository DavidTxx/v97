abstract: This work generalizes graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond those based on
  the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm, graph Laplacians, and diffusions. Our approach,
  denoted Relational Pooling (RP), draws from the theory of finite partial exchangeability
  to provide a framework with maximal representation power for graphs. RP can work
  with existing graph representation models and, somewhat counterintuitively, can
  make them even more powerful than the original WL isomorphism test. Additionally,
  RP allows architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural
  Networks to be used in a theoretically sound approach for graph classification.
  We demonstrate improved performance of RP-based graph representations over state-of-the-art
  methods on a number of tasks.
