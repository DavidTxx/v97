abstract: Conditional kernel mean embeddings form an attractive nonparametric framework
  for representing conditional means of functions, describing the observation processes
  for many complex models. However, the recovery of the original underlying function
  of interest whose conditional mean was observed is a challenging inference task.
  We formalize deconditional kernel mean embeddings as a solution to this inverse
  problem, and show that it can be naturally viewed and used as a nonparametric Bayesâ€™
  rule. Critically, we introduce the notion of task transformed Gaussian processes
  and establish deconditional kernel means embeddings as their posterior predictive
  mean. This connection provides Bayesian interpretations and uncertainty estimates
  for deconditional kernel means, explains their regularization hyperparameters, and
  provides a marginal likelihood for kernel hyperparameter learning. They further
  enable practical applications such as learning sparse representations for big data
  and likelihood-free inference.
