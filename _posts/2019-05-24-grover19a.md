abstract: Graphs are a fundamental abstraction for modeling relational data. However,
  graphs are discrete and combinatorial in nature, and learning representations suitable
  for machine learning tasks poses statistical and computational challenges. In this
  work, we propose Graphite, an algorithmic framework for unsupervised learning of
  representations over nodes in large graphs using deep latent variable generative
  models. Our model parameterizes variational autoencoders (VAE) with graph neural
  networks, and uses a novel iterative graph refinement strategy inspired by low-rank
  approximations for decoding. On a wide variety of synthetic and benchmark datasets,
  Graphite outperforms competing approaches for the tasks of density estimation, link
  prediction, and node classification. Finally, we derive a theoretical connection
  between message passing in graph neural networks and mean-field variational inference.
