abstract: 'Fine-tuning large pretrained models is an effective transfer mechanism
  in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter
  inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative,
  we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible
  model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added
  without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain
  fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapterâ€™s effectiveness,
  we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to $26$ diverse text classification
  tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance,
  whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within $0.8%$ of
  the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only $3.6%$ parameters per task. By
  contrast, fine-tuning trains $100%$ of the parameters per task.'
