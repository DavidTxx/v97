abstract: In classification with a reject option, the classifier is allowed in uncertain
  cases to abstain from prediction. The classical cost based model of an optimal classifier
  with a reject option requires the cost of rejection to be defined explicitly. An
  alternative bounded-improvement model, avoiding the notion of the reject cost, seeks
  for a classifier with a guaranteed selective risk and maximal cover. We prove that
  both models share the same class of optimal strategies, and we provide an explicit
  relation between the reject cost and the target risk being the parameters of the
  two models. An optimal rejection strategy for both models is based on thresholding
  the conditional risk defined by posterior probabilities which are usually unavailable.
  We propose a discriminative algorithm learning an uncertainty function which preserves
  ordering of the input space induced by the conditional risk, and hence can be used
  to construct optimal rejection strategies.
