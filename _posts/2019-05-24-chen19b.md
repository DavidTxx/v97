abstract: An important task in machine learning and statistics is the approximation
  of a probability measure by an empirical measure supported on a discrete point set.
  Stein Points are a class of algorithms for this task, which proceed by sequentially
  minimising a Stein discrepancy between the empirical measure and the target and,
  hence, require the solution of a non-convex optimisation problem to obtain each
  new point. This paper removes the need to solve this optimisation problem by, instead,
  selecting each new point based on a Markov chain sample path. This significantly
  reduces the computational cost of Stein Points and leads to a suite of algorithms
  that are straightforward to implement. The new algorithms are illustrated on a set
  of challenging Bayesian inference problems, and rigorous theoretical guarantees
  of consistency are established.
