abstract: Labeling training data is a key bottleneck in the modern machine learning
  pipeline. Recent weak supervision approaches combine labels from multiple noisy
  sources by estimating their accuracies without access to ground truth labels; however,
  estimating the dependencies among these sources is a critical challenge. We focus
  on a robust PCA-based algorithm for learning these dependency structures, establish
  improved theoretical recovery rates, and outperform existing methods on various
  real-world tasks. Under certain conditions, we show that the amount of unlabeled
  data needed can scale sublinearly or even logarithmically with the number of sources
  m, improving over previous efforts that ignore the sparsity pattern in the dependency
  structure and scale linearly in m. We provide an information-theoretic lower bound
  on the minimum sample complexity of the weak supervision setting. Our method outperforms
  weak supervision approaches that assume conditionally-independent sources by up
  to 4.64 F1 points and previous structure learning approaches by up to 4.41 F1 points
  on real-world relation extraction and image classification tasks.
