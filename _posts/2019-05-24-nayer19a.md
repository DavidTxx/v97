abstract: 'This work proposes the first set of simple, practically useful, and provable
  algorithms for two inter-related problems. (i) The first is low-rank matrix recovery
  from magnitude-only (phaseless) linear projections of each of its columns. This
  finds important applications in phaseless dynamic imaging, e.g., Fourier Ptychographic
  imaging of live biological specimens. Our guarantee shows that, in the regime of
  small ranks, the sample complexity required is only a little larger than the order-optimal
  one, and much smaller than what standard (unstructured) phase retrieval methods
  need. %Moreover our algorithm is fast and memory-efficient if only the minimum required
  number of measurements is used (ii) The second problem we study is a dynamic extension
  of the above: it allows the low-dimensional subspace from which each image/signal
  (each column of the low-rank matrix) is generated to change with time. We introduce
  a simple algorithm that is provably correct as long as the subspace changes are
  piecewise constant.'
