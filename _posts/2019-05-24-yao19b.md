abstract: In order to learn quickly with few samples, meta-learning utilizes prior
  knowledge learned from previous tasks. However, a critical challenge in meta-learning
  is task uncertainty and heterogeneity, which can not be handled via globally sharing
  knowledge among tasks. In this paper, based on gradient-based meta-learning, we
  propose a hierarchically structured meta-learning (HSML) algorithm that explicitly
  tailors the transferable knowledge to different clusters of tasks. Inspired by the
  way human beings organize knowledge, we resort to a hierarchical task clustering
  structure to cluster tasks. As a result, the proposed approach not only addresses
  the challenge via the knowledge customization to different clusters of tasks, but
  also preserves knowledge generalization among a cluster of similar tasks. To tackle
  the changing of task relationship, in addition, we extend the hierarchical structure
  to a continual learning environment. The experimental results show that our approach
  can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both toy-regression and few-shot image
  classification problems.
