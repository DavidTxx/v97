abstract: How can prior knowledge on the transformation invariances of a domain be
  incorporated into the architecture of a neural network? We propose Equivariant Transformers
  (ETs), a family of differentiable image-to-image mappings that improve the robustness
  of models towards pre-defined continuous transformation groups. Through the use
  of specially-derived canonical coordinate systems, ETs incorporate functions that
  are equivariant by construction with respect to these transformations. We show empirically
  that ETs can be flexibly composed to improve model robustness towards more complicated
  transformation groups in several parameters. On a real-world image classification
  task, ETs improve the sample efficiency of ResNet classifiers, achieving relative
  improvements in error rate of up to 15% in the limited data regime while increasing
  model parameter count by less than 1%.
