abstract: We explore the generalization of scattering transforms from traditional
  (e.g., image or audio) signals to graph data, analogous to the generalization of
  ConvNets in geometric deep learning, and the utility of extracted graph features
  in graph data analysis. In particular, we focus on the capacity of these features
  to retain informative variability and relations in the data (e.g., between individual
  graphs, or in aggregate), while relating our construction to previous theoretical
  results that establish the stability of similar transforms to families of graph
  deformations. We demonstrate the application of our geometric scattering features
  in graph classification of social network data, and in data exploration of biochemistry
  data.
