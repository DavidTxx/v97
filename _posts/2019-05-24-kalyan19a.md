abstract: Many sequence prediction tasks admit multiple correct outputs and so, it
  is often useful to decode a set of outputs that maximize some task-specific set-level
  metric. However, retooling standard sequence prediction procedures tailored towards
  predicting the single best output leads to the decoding of sets containing very
  similar sequences; failing to capture the variation in the output space. To address
  this, we propose $\nabla$BS, a trainable decoding procedure that outputs a set of
  sequences, highly valued according to the metric. Our method tightly integrates
  the training and decoding phases and further allows for the optimization of the
  task-specific metric addressing the shortcomings of standard sequence prediction.
  Further, we discuss the trade-offs of commonly used set-level metrics and motivate
  a new set-level metric that naturally evaluates the notion of “capturing the variation
  in the output space”. Finally, we show results on the image captioning task and
  find that our model outperforms standard techniques and natural ablations.
