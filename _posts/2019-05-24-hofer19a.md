abstract: We study the problem of learning representations with controllable connectivity
  properties. This is beneficial in situations when the imposed structure can be leveraged
  upstream. In particular, we control the connectivity of an autoencoderâ€™s latent
  space via a novel type of loss, operating on information from persistent homology.
  Under mild conditions, this loss is differentiable and we present a theoretical
  analysis of the properties induced by the loss. We choose one-class learning as
  our upstream task and demonstrate that the imposed structure enables informed parameter
  selection for modeling the in-class distribution via kernel density estimators.
  Evaluated on computer vision data, these one-class models exhibit competitive performance
  and, in a low sample size regime, outperform other methods by a large margin. Notably,
  our results indicate that a single autoencoder, trained on auxiliary (unlabeled)
  data, yields a mapping into latent space that can be reused across datasets for
  one-class learning.
