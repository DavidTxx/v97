abstract: Deep learning has shown that learned functions can dramatically outperform
  hand-designed functions on perceptual tasks. Analogously, this suggests that learned
  optimizers may similarly outperform current hand-designed optimizers, especially
  for specific problems. However, learned optimizers are notoriously difficult to
  train and have yet to demonstrate wall-clock speedups over hand-designed optimizers,
  and thus are rarely used in practice. Typically, learned optimizers are trained
  by truncated backpropagation through an unrolled optimization process. The resulting
  gradients are either strongly biased (for short truncations) or have exploding norm
  (for long truncations). In this work we propose a training scheme which overcomes
  both of these difficulties, by dynamically weighting two unbiased gradient estimators
  for a variational loss on optimizer performance. This allows us to train neural
  networks to perform optimization of a specific task faster than tuned first-order
  methods. Moreover, by training the optimizer against validation loss (as opposed
  to training loss), we are able to learn optimizers that train networks to generalize
  better than first order methods. We demonstrate these results on problems where
  our learned optimizer trains convolutional networks faster in wall-clock time compared
  to tuned first-order methods and with an improvement in test loss.
