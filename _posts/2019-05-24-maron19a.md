abstract: "Constraining linear layers in neural networks to respect symmetry transformations
  from a group $G$ is a common design principle for invariant networks that has found
  many applications in machine learning. \t\t In this paper, we consider a fundamental
  question that has received very little attention to date: Can these networks approximate
  any (continuous) invariant function? \t\t We tackle the rather general case where
  $G\\leq S_n$ (an arbitrary subgroup of the symmetric group) that acts on $\\R^n$
  by permuting coordinates. This setting includes several recent popular invariant
  networks. We present two main results: First, $G$-invariant networks are universal
  if high-order tensors are allowed. Second, there are groups $G$ for which higher-order
  tensors are unavoidable for obtaining universality. \t\t $G$-invariant networks
  consisting of only first-order tensors are of special interest due to their practical
  value. We conclude the paper by proving a necessary condition for the universality
  of $G$-invariant networks that incorporate only first-order tensors. Lastly, we
  propose a conjecture stating that this condition is also sufficient."
