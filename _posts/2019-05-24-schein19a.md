abstract: 'We present a general and modular method for privacy-preserving Bayesian
  inference for Poisson factorization, a broad class of models that includes some
  of the most widely used models in the social sciences. Our method satisfies limited-precision
  local privacy, a generalization of local differential privacy that we introduce
  to formulate appropriate privacy guarantees for sparse count data. We present an
  MCMC algorithm that approximates the posterior distribution over the latent variables
  conditioned on data that has been locally privatized by the geometric mechanism.
  Our method is based on two insights: 1) a novel reinterpretation of the geometric
  mechanism in terms of the Skellam distribution and 2) a general theorem that relates
  the Skellam and Bessel distributions. We demonstrate our methodâ€™s utility using
  two case studies that involve real-world email data. We show that our method consistently
  outperforms the commonly used naive approach, wherein inference proceeds as usual,
  treating the locally privatized data as if it were not privatized.'
