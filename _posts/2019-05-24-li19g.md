abstract: Powerful adversarial attack methods are vital for understanding how to construct
  robust deep neural networks (DNNs) and for thoroughly testing defense techniques.
  In this paper, we propose a black-box adversarial attack algorithm that can defeat
  both vanilla DNNs and those generated by various defense techniques developed recently.
  Instead of searching for an "optimal" adversarial example for a benign input to
  a targeted DNN, our algorithm finds a probability density distribution over a small
  region centered around the input, such that a sample drawn from this distribution
  is likely an adversarial example, without the need of accessing the DNNâ€™s internal
  layers or weights. Our approach is universal as it can successfully attack different
  neural networks by a single algorithm. It is also strong; according to the testing
  against 2 vanilla DNNs and 13 defended ones, it outperforms state-of-the-art black-box
  or white-box attack methods for most test cases. Additionally, our results reveal
  that adversarial training remains one of the best defense techniques, and the adversarial
  examples are not as transferable across defended DNNs as them across vanilla DNNs.
