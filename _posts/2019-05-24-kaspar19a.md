abstract: Motivated by the recent potential of mass customization brought by whole-garment
  knitting machines, we introduce the new problem of automatic machine instruction
  generation using a single image of the desired physical product, which we apply
  to machine knitting. We propose to tackle this problem by directly learning to synthesize
  regular machine instructions from real images. We create a cured dataset of real
  samples with their instruction counterpart and propose to use synthetic images to
  augment it in a novel way. We theoretically motivate our data mixing framework and
  show empirical results suggesting that making real images look more synthetic is
  beneficial in our problem setup.
