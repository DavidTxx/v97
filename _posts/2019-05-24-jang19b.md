abstract: As the application of deep learning has expanded to real-world problems
  with insufficient volume of training data, transfer learning recently has gained
  much attention as means of improving the performance in such small-data regime.
  However, when existing methods are applied between heterogeneous architectures and
  tasks, it becomes more important to manage their detailed configurations and often
  requires exhaustive tuning on them for the desired performance. To address the issue,
  we propose a novel transfer learning approach based on meta-learning that can automatically
  learn what knowledge to transfer from the source network to where in the target
  network. Given source and target networks, we propose an efficient training scheme
  to learn meta-networks that decide (a) which pairs of layers between the source
  and target networks should be matched for knowledge transfer and (b) which features
  and how much knowledge from each feature should be transferred. We validate our
  meta-transfer approach against recent transfer learning methods on various datasets
  and network architectures, on which our automated scheme significantly outperforms
  the prior baselines that find “what and where to transfer” in a hand-crafted manner.
