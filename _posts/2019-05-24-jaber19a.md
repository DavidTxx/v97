abstract: Causal effect identification is the task of determining whether a causal
  distribution is computable from the combination of an observational distribution
  and substantive knowledge about the domain under investigation. One of the most
  studied versions of this problem assumes that knowledge is articulated in the form
  of a fully known causal diagram, which is arguably a strong assumption in many settings.
  In this paper, we relax this requirement and consider that the knowledge is articulated
  in the form of an equivalence class of causal diagrams, in particular, a partial
  ancestral graph (PAG). This is attractive because a PAG can be learned directly
  from data, and the scientist does not need to commit to a particular, unique diagram.
  There are different sufficient conditions for identification in PAGs, but none is
  complete. We derive a complete algorithm for identification given a PAG. This implies
  that whenever the causal effect is identifiable, the algorithm returns a valid identification
  expression; alternatively, it will throw a failure condition, which means that the
  effect is provably not identifiable. We further provide a graphical characterization
  of non-identifiability of causal effects in PAGs.
