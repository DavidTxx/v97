abstract: 'Text to speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) are two dual
  tasks in speech processing and both achieve impressive performance thanks to the
  recent advance in deep learning and large amount of aligned speech and text data.
  However, the lack of aligned data poses a major practical problem for TTS and ASR
  on low-resource languages. In this paper, by leveraging the dual nature of the two
  tasks, we propose an almost unsupervised learning method that only leverages few
  hundreds of paired data and extra unpaired data for TTS and ASR. Our method consists
  of the following components: (1) denoising auto-encoder, which reconstructs speech
  and text sequences respectively to develop the capability of language modeling both
  in speech and text domain; (2) dual transformation, where the TTS model transforms
  the text $y$ into speech $\hat{x}$, and the ASR model leverages the transformed
  pair $(\hat{x},y)$ for training, and vice versa, to boost the accuracy of the two
  tasks; (3) bidirectional sequence modeling, which address the error propagation
  problem especially in the long speech and text sequence when training with few paired
  data; (4) a unified model structure, which combines all the above components for
  TTS and ASR based on Transformer model. Our method achieves 99.84% in terms of word
  level intelligible rate and 2.68 MOS for TTS, and 11.7% PER for ASR on LJSpeech
  dataset, by leveraging only 200 paired speech and text data (about 20 minutes audio),
  together with extra unpaired speech and text data.'
