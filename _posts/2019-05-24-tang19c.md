abstract: Variational inference transforms posterior inference into parametric optimization
  thereby enabling the use of latent variable models where otherwise impractical.
  However, variational inference can be finicky when different variational parameters
  control variables that are strongly correlated under the model. Traditional natural
  gradients based on the variational approximation fail to correct for correlations
  when the approximation is not the true posterior. To address this, we construct
  a new natural gradient called the Variational Predictive Natural Gradient (VPNG).
  Unlike traditional natural gradients for variational inference, this natural gradient
  accounts for the relationship between model parameters and variational parameters.
  We demonstrate the insight with a simple example as well as the empirical value
  on a classification task, a deep generative model of images, and probabilistic matrix
  factorization for recommendation.
