abstract: Reinforcement learning agents are prone to undesired behaviors due to reward
  mis-specification. Finding a set of reward functions to properly guide agent behaviors
  is particularly challenging in multi-agent scenarios. Inverse reinforcement learning
  provides a framework to automatically acquire suitable reward functions from expert
  demonstrations. Its extension to multi-agent settings, however, is difficult due
  to the more complex notions of rational behaviors. In this paper, we propose MA-AIRL,
  a new framework for multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning, which is effective
  and scalable for Markov games with high-dimensional state-action space and unknown
  dynamics. We derive our algorithm based on a new solution concept and maximum pseudolikelihood
  estimation within an adversarial reward learning framework. In the experiments,
  we demonstrate that MA-AIRL can recover reward functions that are highly correlated
  with the ground truth rewards, while significantly outperforms prior methods in
  terms of policy imitation.
