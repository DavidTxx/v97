abstract: Configurable Markov Decision Processes (Conf-MDPs) have been recently introduced
  as an extension of the usual MDP model to account for the possibility of configuring
  the environment to improve the agentâ€™s performance. Currently, there is still no
  suitable algorithm to solve the learning problem for real-world Conf-MDPs. In this
  paper, we fill this gap by proposing a trust-region method, Relative Entropy Model
  Policy Search (REMPS), able to learn both the policy and the MDP configuration in
  continuous domains without requiring the knowledge of the true model of the environment.
  After introducing our approach and providing a finite-sample analysis, we empirically
  evaluate REMPS on both benchmark and realistic environments by comparing our results
  with those of the gradient methods.
