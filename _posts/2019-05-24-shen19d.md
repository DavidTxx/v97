abstract: "Reducing the variance of estimators for policy gradient has long been the
  focus of reinforcement learning research. \tWhile classic algorithms like REINFORCE
  find an $\\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point in $\\OM({1}/{\\epsilon^4})$
  random trajectory simulations, no provable improvement on the complexity has been
  made so far. \tThis paper presents a Hessian aided policy gradient method with the
  first improved sample complexity of $\\OM({1}/{\\epsilon^3})$. \tWhile our method
  exploits information from the policy Hessian, it can be implemented in linear time
  with respect to the parameter dimension and is hence applicable to sophisticated
  DNN parameterization. \tSimulations on standard tasks validate the efficiency of
  our method."
