abstract: 'Testing Bayesian Networks (TBNs) were introduced recently to represent
  a set of distributions, one of which is selected based on the given evidence and
  used for reasoning. TBNs are more expressive than classical Bayesian Networks (BNs):
  Marginal queries correspond to multi-linear functions in BNs and to piecewise multi-linear
  functions in TBNs. Moreover, TBN queries are universal approximators, like neural
  networks. In this paper, we study conditional independence in TBNs, showing that
  it can be inferred from d-separation as in BNs. We also study the role of TBN expressiveness
  and independence in dealing with the problem of learning with incomplete models
  (i.e., ones that miss nodes or edges from the data-generating model). Finally, we
  illustrate our results on a number of concrete examples, including a case study
  on Hidden Markov Models.'
