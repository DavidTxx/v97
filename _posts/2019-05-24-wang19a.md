abstract: This work addresses the situation where a black-box model with good predictive
  performance is chosen over its interpretable competitors, and we show interpretability
  is still achievable in this case. Our solution is to find an interpretable substitute
  on a subset of data where the black-box model is <em>overkill</em> or nearly overkill
  while leaving the rest to the black-box. This transparency is obtained at minimal
  cost or no cost of the predictive performance. Under this framework, we develop
  a Hybrid Rule Sets (HyRS) model that uses decision rules to capture the subspace
  of data where the rules are as accurate or almost as accurate as the black-box provided.
  To train a HyRS, we devise an efficient search algorithm that iteratively finds
  the optimal model and exploits theoretically grounded strategies to reduce computation.
  Our framework is <em>agnostic</em> to the black-box during training. Experiments
  on structured and text data show that HyRS obtains an effective trade-off between
  transparency and interpretability.
