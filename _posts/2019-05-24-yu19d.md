abstract: Recent developments on large-scale distributed machine learning applications,
  e.g., deep neural networks, benefit enormously from the advances in distributed
  non-convex optimization techniques, e.g., distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent
  (SGD). A series of recent works study the linear speedup property of distributed
  SGD variants with reduced communication. The linear speedup property enables us
  to scale out the computing capability by adding more computing nodes into our system.
  The reduced communication complexity is desirable since communication overhead is
  often the performance bottleneck in distributed systems. Recently, momentum methods
  are more and more widely adopted by practitioners to train machine learning models
  since they can often converge faster and generalize better. However, it remains
  unclear whether any distributed momentum SGD possesses the same linear speedup property
  as distributed SGD and has reduced communication complexity. This paper fills the
  gap by considering a distributed communication efficient momentum SGD method and
  proving its linear speedup property.
