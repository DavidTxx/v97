abstract: We provide an online convex optimization algorithm with regret that interpolates
  between the regret of an algorithm using an optimal preconditioning matrix and one
  using a diagonal preconditioning matrix. Our regret bound is never worse than that
  obtained by diagonal preconditioning, and in certain setting even surpasses that
  of algorithms with full-matrix preconditioning. Importantly, our algorithm runs
  in the same time and space complexity as online gradient descent. Along the way
  we incorporate new techniques that mildly streamline and improve logarithmic factors
  in prior regret analyses. We conclude by benchmarking our algorithm on synthetic
  data and deep learning tasks.
