abstract: In this article we revisit the definition of Precision-Recall (PR) curves
  for generative models proposed by (Sajjadi et al., 2018). Rather than providing
  a scalar for generative quality, PR curves distinguish mode-collapse (poor recall)
  and bad quality (poor precision). We first generalize their formulation to arbitrary
  measures hence removing any restriction to finite support. We also expose a bridge
  between PR curves and type I and type II error (a.k.a. false detection and rejection)
  rates of likelihood ratio classifiers on the task of discriminating between samples
  of the two distributions. Building upon this new perspective, we propose a novel
  algorithm to approximate precision-recall curves, that shares some interesting methodological
  properties with the hypothesis testing technique from (Lopez-Paz & Oquab, 2017).
  We demonstrate the interest of the proposed formulation over the original approach
  on controlled multi-modal datasets.
