abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to achieve optimal
  approximation and estimation error rates (in minimax sense) in several function
  classes. However, previous analyzed optimal CNNs are unrealistically wide and difficult
  to obtain via optimization due to sparse constraints in important function classes,
  including the Hölder class. We show a ResNet-type CNN can attain the minimax optimal
  error rates in these classes in more plausible situations – it can be dense, and
  its width, channel size, and filter size are constant with respect to sample size.
  The key idea is that we can replicate the learning ability of Fully-connected neural
  networks (FNNs) by tailored CNNs, as long as the FNNs have <em>block-sparse</em>
  structures. Our theory is general in a sense that we can automatically translate
  any approximation rate achieved by block-sparse FNNs into that by CNNs. As an application,
  we derive approximation and estimation error rates of the aformentioned type of
  CNNs for the Barron and Hölder classes with the same strategy.
