abstract: 'Computing Nash equilibrium (NE) of multi-player games has witnessed renewed
  interest due to recent advances in generative adversarial networks. However, computing
  equilibrium efficiently is challenging. To this end, we introduce the Gradient-based
  Nikaido-Isoda (GNI) function which serves: (i) as a merit function, vanishing only
  at the first-order stationary points of each player’s optimization problem, and
  (ii) provides error bounds to a stationary Nash point. Gradient descent is shown
  to converge sublinearly to a first-order stationary point of the GNI function. For
  the particular case of bilinear min-max games and multi-player quadratic games,
  the GNI function is convex. Hence, the application of gradient descent in this case
  yields linear convergence to an NE (when one exists). In our numerical experiments,
  we observe that the GNI formulation always converges to the first-order stationary
  point of each player’s optimization problem.'
