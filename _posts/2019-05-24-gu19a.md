abstract: We develop a framework of generalized multinomial models, which includes
  both the popular Plackett–Luce model and Bradley–Terry model as special cases. From
  a theoretical perspective, we prove that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
  under generalized multinomial models corresponds to the stationary distribution
  of an inhomogeneous Markov chain uniquely. Based on this property, we propose an
  iterative algorithm that is easy to implement and interpret, and is guaranteed to
  converge. Numerical experiments on synthetic data and real data demonstrate the
  advantages of our Markov chain based algorithm over existing ones. Our algorithm
  converges to the MLE with fewer iterations and at a faster convergence rate. The
  new algorithm is readily applicable to problems such as page ranking or sports ranking
  data.
