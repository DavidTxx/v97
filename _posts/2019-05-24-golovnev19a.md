abstract: 'We quantify the separation between the numbers of labeled examples required
  to learn in two settings: Settings with and without the knowledge of the distribution
  of the unlabeled data. More specifically, we prove a separation by $\Theta(\log
  n)$ multiplicative factor for the class of projections over the Boolean hypercube
  of dimension $n$. We prove that there is no separation for the class of all functions
  on domain of any size. Learning with the knowledge of the distribution (a.k.a. fixed-distribution
  learning) can be viewed as an idealized scenario of semi-supervised learning where
  the number of unlabeled data points is so great that the unlabeled distribution
  is known exactly. For this reason, we call the separation the value of unlabeled
  data.'
