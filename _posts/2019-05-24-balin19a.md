abstract: We introduce the concrete autoencoder, an end-to-end differentiable method
  for global feature selection, which efficiently identifies a subset of the most
  informative features and simultaneously learns a neural network to reconstruct the
  input data from the selected features. Our method is unsupervised, and is based
  on using a concrete selector layer as the encoder and using a standard neural network
  as the decoder. During the training phase, the temperature of the concrete selector
  layer is gradually decreased, which encourages a user-specified number of discrete
  features to be learned; during test time, the selected features can be used with
  the decoder network to reconstruct the remaining input features. We evaluate concrete
  autoencoders on a variety of datasets, where they significantly outperform state-of-the-art
  methods for feature selection and data reconstruction. In particular, on a large-scale
  gene expression dataset, the concrete autoencoder selects a small subset of genes
  whose expression levels can be used to impute the expression levels of the remaining
  genes; in doing so, it improves on the current widely-used expert-curated L1000
  landmark genes, potentially reducing measurement costs by 20%. The concrete autoencoder
  can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard autoencoder,
  and the code for the algorithm and experiments is publicly available.
