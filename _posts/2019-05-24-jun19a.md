abstract: We introduce the bilinear bandit problem with low-rank structure in which
  an action takes the form of a pair of arms from two different entity types, and
  the reward is a bilinear function of the known feature vectors of the arms. The
  unknown in the problem is a $d_1$ by $d_2$ matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}^*$ that defines
  the reward, and has low rank $r \ll \min\{d_1,d_2\}$. Determination of $\mathbf{\Theta}^*$
  with this low-rank structure poses a significant challenge in finding the right
  exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In this work, we propose a new two-stage algorithm
  called “Explore-Subspace-Then-Refine” (ESTR). The first stage is an explicit subspace
  exploration, while the second stage is a linear bandit algorithm called “almost-low-dimensional
  OFUL” (LowOFUL) that exploits and further refines the estimated subspace via a regularization
  technique. We show that the regret of ESTR is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((d_1+d_2)^{3/2}
  \sqrt{r T})$ where $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic factors and $T$ is
  the time horizon, which improves upon the regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d_1d_2\sqrt{T})$
  attained for a naïve linear bandit reduction. We conjecture that the regret bound
  of ESTR is unimprovable up to polylogarithmic factors, and our preliminary experiment
  shows that ESTR outperforms a naïve linear bandit reduction.
