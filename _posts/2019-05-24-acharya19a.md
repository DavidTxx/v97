abstract: A central server needs to perform statistical inference based on samples
  that are distributed over multiple users who can each send a message of limited
  length to the center. We study problems of distribution learning and identity testing
  in this distributed inference setting and examine the role of shared randomness
  as a resource. We propose a general purpose <em>simulate-and-infer</em> strategy
  that uses only private-coin communication protocols and is sample-optimal for distribution
  learning. This general strategy turns out to be sample-optimal even for distribution
  testing among private-coin protocols. Interestingly, we propose a public-coin protocol
  that outperforms simulate-and-infer for distribution testing and is, in fact, sample-optimal.
  Underlying our public-coin protocol is a random hash that when applied to the samples
  minimally contracts the chi-squared distance of their distribution from the uniform
  distribution.
