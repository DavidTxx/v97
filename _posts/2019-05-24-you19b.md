abstract: 'Learning node embeddings that capture a nodeâ€™s position within the broader
  graph structure is crucial for many prediction tasks on graphs. However, existing
  Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures have limited power in capturing the position/location
  of a given node with respect to all other nodes of the graph. Here we propose Position-aware
  Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a new class of GNNs for computing position-aware
  node embeddings. P-GNN first samples sets of anchor nodes, computes the distance
  of a given target node to each anchor-set, and then learns a non-linear distance-weighted
  aggregation scheme over the anchor-sets. This way P-GNNs can capture positions/locations
  of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they
  are inductive, scalable, and can incorporate node feature information. We apply
  P-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community detection.
  We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state of the art GNNs, with up to 66%
  improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score.'
