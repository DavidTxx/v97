abstract: 'We propose CAVIA for meta-learning, a simple extension to MAML that is
  less prone to meta-overfitting, easier to parallelise, and more interpretable. CAVIA
  partitions the model parameters into two parts: context parameters that serve as
  additional input to the model and are adapted on individual tasks, and shared parameters
  that are meta-trained and shared across tasks. At test time, only the context parameters
  are updated, leading to a low-dimensional task representation. We show empirically
  that CAVIA outperforms MAML for regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.
  Our experiments also highlight weaknesses in current benchmarks, in that the amount
  of adaptation needed in some cases is small.'
