abstract: 'There are two types of ordinary differential equations (ODEs): initial
  value problems (IVPs) and boundary value problems (BVPs). While many probabilistic
  numerical methods for the solution of IVPs have been presented to-date, there exists
  no efficient probabilistic general-purpose solver for nonlinear BVPs. Our method
  based on iterated Gaussian process (GP) regression returns a GP posterior over the
  solution of nonlinear ODEs, which provides a meaningful error estimation via its
  predictive posterior standard deviation. Our solver is fast (typically of quadratic
  convergence rate) and the theory of convergence can be transferred from prior non-probabilistic
  work. Our method performs on par with standard codes for an established benchmark
  of test problems.'
