abstract: Classifiers can be trained with data-dependent constraints to satisfy fairness
  goals, reduce churn, achieve a targeted false positive rate, or other policy goals.
  We study the generalization performance for such constrained optimization problems,
  in terms of how well the constraints are satisfied at evaluation time, given that
  they are satisfied at training time. To improve generalization, we frame the problem
  as a two-player game where one player optimizes the model parameters on a training
  dataset, and the other player enforces the constraints on an independent validation
  dataset. We build on recent work in two-player constrained optimization to show
  that if one uses this two-dataset approach, then constraint generalization can be
  significantly improved. As we illustrate experimentally, this approach works not
  only in theory, but also in practice.
