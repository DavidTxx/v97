abstract: This study addresses an issue of co-adaptation between a feature extractor
  and a classifier in a neural network. A naive joint optimization of a feature extractor
  and a classifier often brings situations in which an excessively complex feature
  distribution adapted to a very specific classifier degrades the test performance.
  We introduce a method called Feature-extractor Optimization through Classifier Anonymization
  (FOCA), which is designed to avoid an explicit co-adaptation between a feature extractor
  and a particular classifier by using many randomly-generated, weak classifiers during
  optimization. We put forth a mathematical proposition that states the FOCA features
  form a point-like distribution within the same class in a class-separable fashion
  under special conditions. Real-data experiments under more general conditions provide
  supportive evidences.
