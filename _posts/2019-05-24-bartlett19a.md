abstract: 'We address the problem of planning in an environment with deterministic
  dynamics and stochastic discounted rewards under a limited numerical budget where
  the ranges of both rewards and noise are unknown. We introduce PlaTypOOS, an adaptive,
  robust, and efficient alternative to the OLOP (open-loop optimistic planning) algorithm.
  Whereas OLOP requires a priori knowledge of the ranges of both rewards and noise,
  PlaTypOOS dynamically adapts its behavior to both. This allows PlaTypOOS to be immune
  to two vulnerabilities of OLOP: failure when given underestimated ranges of noise
  and rewards and inefficiency when these are overestimated. PlaTypOOS additionally
  adapts to the global smoothness of the value function. PlaTypOOS acts in a provably
  more efficient manner vs. OLOP when OLOP is given an overestimated reward and show
  that in the case of no noise, PlaTypOOS learns exponentially faster.'
