abstract: Generalizing causal effects from a controlled experiment to settings beyond
  the particular study population is arguably one of the central tasks found in empirical
  circles. While a proper design and careful execution of the experiment would support,
  under mild conditions, the validity of inferences about the population in which
  the experiment was conducted, two challenges make the extrapolation step to different
  populations somewhat involved, namely, transportability and sampling selection bias.
  The former is concerned with disparities in the distributions and causal mechanisms
  between the domain (i.e., settings, population, environment) where the experiment
  is conducted and where the inferences are intended; the latter with distortions
  in the sampleâ€™s proportions due to preferential selection of units into the study.
  In this paper, we investigate the assumptions and machinery necessary for using
  <em>covariate adjustment</em> to correct for the biases generated by both of these
  problems, and generalize experimental data to infer causal effects in a new domain.
  We derive complete graphical conditions to determine if a set of covariates is admissible
  for adjustment in this new setting. Building on the graphical characterization,
  we develop an efficient algorithm that enumerates all possible admissible sets with
  poly-time delay guarantee; this can be useful for when some variables are preferred
  over the others due to different costs or amenability to measurement.
