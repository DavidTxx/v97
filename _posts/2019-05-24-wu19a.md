abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn an optimal policy from demonstrations.
  However, such demonstrations are often imperfect since collecting optimal ones is
  costly. To effectively learn from imperfect demonstrations, we propose a novel approach
  that utilizes confidence scores, which describe the quality of demonstrations. More
  specifically, we propose two confidence-based IL methods, namely two-step importance
  weighting IL (2IWIL) and generative adversarial IL with imperfect demonstration
  and confidence (IC-GAIL). We show that confidence scores given only to a small portion
  of sub-optimal demonstrations significantly improve the performance of IL both theoretically
  and empirically.
