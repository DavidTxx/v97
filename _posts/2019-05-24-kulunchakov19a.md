abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a unified view of gradient-based algorithms for
  stochastic convex composite optimization by extending the concept of estimate sequence
  introduced by Nesterov. This point of view covers the stochastic gradient descent
  method, variants of the approaches SAGA, SVRG, and has several advantages: (i) we
  provide a generic proof of convergence for the aforementioned methods; (ii) we show
  that this SVRG variant is adaptive to strong convexity; (iii) we naturally obtain
  new algorithms with the same guarantees; (iv) we derive generic strategies to make
  these algorithms robust to stochastic noise, which is useful when data is corrupted
  by small random perturbations. Finally, we show that this viewpoint is useful to
  obtain new accelerated algorithms in the sense of Nesterov.'
