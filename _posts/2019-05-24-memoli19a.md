abstract: We introduce the Wasserstein transform, a method for enhancing and denoising
  datasets defined on general metric spaces. The construction draws inspiration from
  Optimal Transportation ideas. We establish the stability of our method under data
  perturbation and, when the dataset is assumed to be Euclidean, we also exhibit a
  precise connection between the Wasserstein transform and the mean shift family of
  algorithms. We then use this connection to prove that mean shift also inherits stability
  under perturbations. We study the performance of the Wasserstein transform method
  on different datasets as a preprocessing step prior to clustering and classification
  tasks.
