abstract: Random Fourier features is a widely used, simple, and effective technique
  for scaling up kernel methods. The existing theoretical analysis of the approach,
  however, remains focused on specific learning tasks and typically gives pessimistic
  bounds which are at odds with the empirical results. We tackle these problems and
  provide the first unified risk analysis of learning with random Fourier features
  using the squared error and Lipschitz continuous loss functions. In our bounds,
  the trade-off between the computational cost and the expected risk convergence rate
  is problem specific and expressed in terms of the regularization parameter and the
  <em>number of effective degrees of freedom</em>. We study both the standard random
  Fourier features method for which we improve the existing bounds on the number of
  features required to guarantee the corresponding minimax risk convergence rate of
  kernel ridge regression, as well as a data-dependent modification which samples
  features proportional to <em>ridge leverage scores</em> and further reduces the
  required number of features. As ridge leverage scores are expensive to compute,
  we devise a simple approximation scheme which provably reduces the computational
  cost without loss of statistical efficiency.
