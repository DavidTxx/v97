abstract: Plug-and-play (PnP) is a non-convex framework that integrates modern denoising
  priors, such as BM3D or deep learning-based denoisers, into ADMM or other proximal
  algorithms. An advantage of PnP is that one can use pre-trained denoisers when there
  is not sufficient data for end-to-end training. Although PnP has been recently studied
  extensively with great empirical success, theoretical analysis addressing even the
  most basic question of convergence has been insufficient. In this paper, we theoretically
  establish convergence of PnP-FBS and PnP-ADMM, without using diminishing stepsizes,
  under a certain Lipschitz condition on the denoisers. We then propose real spectral
  normalization, a technique for training deep learning-based denoisers to satisfy
  the proposed Lipschitz condition. Finally, we present experimental results validating
  the theory.
