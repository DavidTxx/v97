abstract: 'We address the problem of algorithmic fairness: ensuring that the outcome
  of a classifier is not biased towards certain values of sensitive variables such
  as age, race or gender. As common fairness metrics can be expressed as measures
  of (conditional) independence between variables, we propose to use the Rényi maximum
  correlation coefficient to generalize fairness measurement to continuous variables.
  We exploit Witsenhausen’s characterization of the Rényi correlation coefficient
  to propose a differentiable implementation linked to $f$-divergences. This allows
  us to generalize fairness-aware learning to continuous variables by using a penalty
  that upper bounds this coefficient. Theses allows fairness to be extented to variables
  such as mixed ethnic groups or financial status without thresholds effects. This
  penalty can be estimated on mini-batches allowing to use deep nets. Experiments
  show favorable comparisons to state of the art on binary variables and prove the
  ability to protect continuous ones'
