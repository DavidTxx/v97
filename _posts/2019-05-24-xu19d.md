abstract: A significant challenge for the practical application of reinforcement learning
  to real world problems is the need to specify an oracle reward function that correctly
  defines a task. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to avoid this challenge
  by instead inferring a reward function from expert demonstrations. While appealing,
  it can be impractically expensive to collect datasets of demonstrations that cover
  the variation common in the real world (e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in
  practice, IRL must commonly be performed with only a limited set of demonstrations
  where it can be exceedingly difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function.
  In this work, we exploit the insight that demonstrations from other tasks can be
  used to constrain the set of possible reward functions by learning a "prior" that
  is specifically optimized for the ability to infer expressive reward functions from
  limited numbers of demonstrations. We demonstrate that our method can efficiently
  recover rewards from images for novel tasks and provide intuition as to how our
  approach is analogous to learning a prior.
