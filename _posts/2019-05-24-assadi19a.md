abstract: Maximum weight matching is one of the most fundamental combinatorial optimization
  problems with a wide range of applications in data mining and bioinformatics. Developing
  distributed weighted matching algorithms has been challenging due to the sequential
  nature of efficient algorithms for this problem. In this paper, we develop a simple
  distributed algorithm for the problem on general graphs with approximation guarantee
  of 2 + eps that (nearly) matches that of the sequential greedy algorithm. A key
  advantage of this algorithm is that it can be easily implemented in only two rounds
  of computation in modern parallel computation frameworks such as MapReduce. We also
  demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm in practice on various graphs (some
  with half a trillion edges) by achieving objective values always close to what is
  achievable in the centralized setting.
