abstract: Excellent variational approximations to Gaussian process posteriors have
  been developed which avoid the $\mathcal{O}\left(N^3\right)$ scaling with dataset
  size $N$. They reduce the computational cost to $\mathcal{O}\left(NM^2\right)$,
  with $M\ll N$ the number of <em>inducing variables</em>, which summarise the process.
  While the computational cost seems to be linear in $N$, the true complexity of the
  algorithm depends on how $M$ must increase to ensure a certain quality of approximation.
  We show that with high probability the KL divergence can be made arbitrarily small
  by growing $M$ more slowly than $N$. A particular case is that for regression with
  normally distributed inputs in D-dimensions with the Squared Exponential kernel,
  $M=\mathcal{O}(\log^D N)$ suffices. Our results show that as datasets grow, Gaussian
  process posteriors can be approximated cheaply, and provide a concrete rule for
  how to increase $M$ in continual learning scenarios.
