abstract: Linear encoding of sparse vectors is widely popular, but is commonly data-independent
  â€“ missing any possible extra (but a priori unknown) structure beyond sparsity. In
  this paper we present a new method to learn linear encoders that adapt to data,
  while still performing well with the widely used $\ell_1$ decoder. The convex $\ell_1$
  decoder prevents gradient propagation as needed in standard gradient-based training.
  Our method is based on the insight that unrolling the convex decoder into $T$ projected
  subgradient steps can address this issue. Our method can be seen as a data-driven
  way to learn a compressed sensing measurement matrix. We compare the empirical performance
  of 10 algorithms over 6 sparse datasets (3 synthetic and 3 real). Our experiments
  show that there is indeed additional structure beyond sparsity in the real datasets;
  our method is able to discover it and exploit it to create excellent reconstructions
  with fewer measurements (by a factor of 1.1-3x) compared to the previous state-of-the-art
  methods. We illustrate an application of our method in learning label embeddings
  for extreme multi-label classification, and empirically show that our method is
  able to match or outperform the precision scores of SLEEC, which is one of the state-of-the-art
  embedding-based approaches.
