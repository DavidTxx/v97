abstract: The well known domain shift issue causes model performance to degrade when
  deployed to a new target domain with different statistics to training. Domain adaptation
  techniques alleviate this, but need some instances from the target domain to drive
  adaptation. Domain generalisation is the recently topical problem of learning a
  model that generalises to unseen domains out of the box, and various approaches
  aim to train a domain-invariant feature extractor, typically by adding some manually
  designed losses. In this work, we propose a learning to learn approach, where the
  auxiliary loss that helps generalisation is itself learned. Beyond conventional
  domain generalisation, we consider a more challenging setting of heterogeneous domain
  generalisation, where the unseen domains do not share label space with the seen
  ones, and the goal is to train a feature representation that is useful off-the-shelf
  for novel data and novel categories. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our
  method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in both settings.
