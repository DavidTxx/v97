abstract: The study of adversarial robustness has so far largely focused on perturbations
  bound in $\ell_p$-norms. However, state-of-the-art models turn out to be also vulnerable
  to other, more natural classes of perturbations such as translations and rotations.
  In this work, we thoroughly investigate the vulnerability of neural networkâ€“based
  classifiers to rotations and translations. While data augmentation offers relatively
  small robustness, we use ideas from robust optimization and test-time input aggregation
  to significantly improve robustness. Finally we find that, in contrast to the $\ell_p$-norm
  case, first-order methods cannot reliably find worst-case perturbations. This highlights
  spatial robustness as a fundamentally different setting requiring additional study.
