abstract: We explore value-based solutions for multi-agent reinforcement learning
  (MARL) tasks in the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) regime
  popularized recently. However, VDN and QMIX are representative examples that use
  the idea of factorization of the joint action-value function into individual ones
  for decentralized execution. VDN and QMIX address only a fraction of factorizable
  MARL tasks due to their structural constraint in factorization such as additivity
  and monotonicity. In this paper, we propose a new factorization method for MARL,
  QTRAN, which is free from such structural constraints and takes on a new approach
  to transforming the original joint action-value function into an easily factorizable
  one, with the same optimal actions. QTRAN guarantees more general factorization
  than VDN or QMIX, thus covering a much wider class of MARL tasks than does previous
  methods. Our experiments for the tasks of multi-domain Gaussian-squeeze and modified
  predator-prey demonstrate QTRANâ€™s superior performance with especially larger margins
  in games whose payoffs penalize non-cooperative behavior more aggressively.
