abstract: 'Differentially private learning algorithms protect individual participants
  in the training dataset by guaranteeing that their presence does not significantly
  change the resulting model. In order to make this promise, such algorithms need
  to know the maximum contribution that can be made by a single user: the more data
  an individual can contribute, the more noise will need to be added to protect them.
  While most existing analyses assume that the maximum contribution is known and fixed
  in advance{—}indeed, it is often assumed that each user contributes only a single
  example{—}we argue that in practice there is a meaningful choice to be made. On
  the one hand, if we allow users to contribute large amounts of data, we may end
  up adding excessive noise to protect a few outliers, even when the majority contribute
  only modestly. On the other hand, limiting users to small contributions keeps noise
  levels low at the cost of potentially discarding significant amounts of excess data,
  thus introducing bias. Here, we characterize this trade-off for an empirical risk
  minimization setting, showing that in general there is a “sweet spot” that depends
  on measurable properties of the dataset, but that there is also a concrete cost
  to privacy that cannot be avoided simply by collecting more data.'
