abstract: Approximate policy iteration is a class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
  where the policy is encoded using a function approximator and which has been especially
  prominent in RL with continuous action spaces. In this class of RL algorithms, ensuring
  increase of the policy return during policy update often requires to constrain the
  change in action distribution. Several approximations exist in the literature to
  solve this constrained policy update problem. In this paper, we propose to improve
  over such solutions by introducing a set of projections that transform the constrained
  problem into an unconstrained one which is then solved by standard gradient descent.
  Using these projections, we empirically demonstrate that our approach can improve
  the policy update solution and the control over exploration of existing approximate
  policy iteration algorithms.
