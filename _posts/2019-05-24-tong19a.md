abstract: Analyzing multivariate time series data is important to predict future events
  and changes of complex systems in finance, manufacturing, and administrative decisions.
  The expressiveness power of Gaussian Process (GP) regression methods has been significantly
  improved by compositional covariance structures. In this paper, we present a new
  GP model which naturally handles multiple time series by placing an Indian Buffet
  Process (IBP) prior on the presence of shared kernels. Our selective covariance
  structure decomposition allows exploiting shared parameters over a set of multiple,
  selected time series. We also investigate the well-definedness of the models when
  infinite latent components are introduced. We present a pragmatic search algorithm
  which explores a larger structure space efficiently. Experiments conducted on five
  real-world data sets demonstrate that our new model outperforms existing methods
  in term of structure discoveries and predictive performances.
