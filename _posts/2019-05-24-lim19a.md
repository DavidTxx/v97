abstract: The robust Markov decision processes (MDP) framework aims to address the
  problem of parameter uncertainty due to model mismatch, approximation errors or
  even adversarial behaviors. It is especially relevant when deploying the learned
  policies in real-world applications. Scaling up the robust MDP framework to large
  or continuous state space remains a challenging problem. The use of function approximation
  in this case is usually inevitable and this can only amplify the problem of model
  mismatch and parameter uncertainties. It has been previously shown that, in the
  case of MDPs with state aggregation, the robust policies enjoy a tighter performance
  bound compared to standard solutions due to its reduced sensitivity to approximation
  errors. We extend these results to the much larger class of kernel-based approximators
  and show, both analytically and empirically that the robust policies can significantly
  outperform the non-robust counterpart.
