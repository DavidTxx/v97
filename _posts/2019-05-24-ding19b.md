abstract: Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) is a recently proposed non-convex
  optimization based method for learning subspaces of high relative dimension from
  noiseless datasets contaminated by as many outliers as the square of the number
  of inliers. Experimentally, DPCP has proved to be robust to noise and outperform
  the popular RANSAC on 3D vision tasks such as road plane detection and relative
  poses estimation from three views. This paper extends the global optimality and
  convergence theory of DPCP to the case of data corrupted by noise, and further demonstrates
  its robustness using synthetic and real data.
