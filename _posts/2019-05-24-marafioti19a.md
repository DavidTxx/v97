abstract: Time-frequency (TF) representations provide powerful and intuitive features
  for the analysis of time series such as audio. But still, generative modeling of
  audio in the TF domain is a subtle matter. Consequently, neural audio synthesis
  widely relies on directly modeling the waveform and previous attempts at unconditionally
  synthesizing audio from neurally generated invertible TF features still struggle
  to produce audio at satisfying quality. In this article, focusing on the short-time
  Fourier transform, we discuss the challenges that arise in audio synthesis based
  on generated invertible TF features and how to overcome them. We demonstrate the
  potential of deliberate generative TF modeling by training a generative adversarial
  network (GAN) on short-time Fourier features. We show that by applying our guidelines,
  our TF-based network was able to outperform a state-of-the-art GAN generating waveforms
  directly, despite the similar architecture in the two networks.
