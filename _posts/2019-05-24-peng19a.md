abstract: In this paper, we study two challenges in clustering analysis, namely, how
  to cluster multi-view data and how to perform clustering without parameter selection
  on cluster size. To this end, we propose a novel objective function to project raw
  data into one space in which the projection embraces the geometric consistency (GC)
  and the cluster assignment consistency (CAC). To be specific, the GC aims to learn
  a connection graph from a projection space wherein the data points are connected
  if and only if they belong to the same cluster. The CAC aims to minimize the discrepancy
  of pairwise connection graphs induced from different views based on the view-consensus
  assumption, <em>i.e.</em>, different views could produce the same cluster assignment
  structure as they are different portraits of the same object. Thanks to the view-consensus
  derived from the connection graph, our method could achieve promising performance
  in learning view-specific representation and eliminating the heterogeneous gaps
  across different views. Furthermore, with the proposed objective, it could learn
  almost all parameters including the cluster number from data without labor-intensive
  parameter selection. Extensive experimental results show the promising performance
  achieved by our method on five datasets comparing with nine state-of-the-art multi-view
  clustering approaches.
