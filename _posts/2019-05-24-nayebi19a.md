abstract: We present a theoretically founded approach for high-dimensional Bayesian
  optimization based on low-dimensional subspace embeddings. We prove that the error
  in the Gaussian process model is bounded tightly when going from the original high-dimensional
  search domain to the low-dimensional embedding. This implies that the optimization
  process in the low-dimensional embedding proceeds essentially as if it were run
  directly on an unknown active subspace of low dimensionality. The argument applies
  to a large class of algorithms and GP models, including non-stationary kernels.
  Moreover, we provide an efficient implementation based on hashing and demonstrate
  empirically that this subspace embedding achieves considerably better results than
  the previously proposed methods for high-dimensional BO based on Gaussian matrix
  projections and structure-learning.
