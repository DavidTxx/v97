abstract: In importance sampling (IS)-based reinforcement learning algorithms such
  as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), IS weights are typically clipped to avoid
  large variance in learning. However, policy update from clipped statistics induces
  large bias in tasks with high action dimensions, and bias from clipping makes it
  difficult to reuse old samples with large IS weights. In this paper, we consider
  PPO, a representative on-policy algorithm, and propose its improvement by dimension-wise
  IS weight clipping which separately clips the IS weight of each action dimension
  to avoid large bias and adaptively controls the IS weight to bound policy update
  from the current policy. This new technique enables efficient learning for high
  action-dimensional tasks and reusing of old samples like in off-policy learning
  to increase the sample efficiency. Numerical results show that the proposed new
  algorithm outperforms PPO and other RL algorithms in various Open AI Gym tasks.
