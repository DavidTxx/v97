abstract: Batch Bayesian optimization has been shown to be an efficient and successful
  approach for black-box function optimization, especially when the evaluation of
  cost function is highly expensive but can be efficiently parallelized. In this paper,
  we introduce a novel variational framework for batch query optimization, based on
  the argument that the query batch should be selected to have both high diversity
  and good worst case performance. This motivates us to introduce a variational objective
  that combines a quantile-based risk measure (for worst case performance) and entropy
  regularization (for enforcing diversity). We derive a gradient-based particle-based
  algorithm for solving our quantile-based variational objective, which generalizes
  Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). We evaluate our method on a number of
  real-world applications and show that it consistently outperforms other recent state-of-the-art
  batch Bayesian optimization methods. Extensive experimental results indicate that
  our method achieves better or comparable performance, compared to the existing methods.
