abstract: Set functions predict a label from a permutation-invariant variable-size
  collection of feature vectors. We propose making set functions more understandable
  and regularized by capturing domain knowledge through shape constraints. We show
  how prior work in monotonic constraints can be adapted to set functions, and then
  propose two new shape constraints designed to generalize the conditioning role of
  weights in a weighted mean. We show how one can train standard functions and set
  functions that satisfy these shape constraints with a deep lattice network. We propose
  a nonlinear estimation strategy we call the semantic feature engine that uses set
  functions with the proposed shape constraints to estimate labels for compound sparse
  categorical features. Experiments on real-world data show the achieved accuracy
  is similar to deep sets or deep neural networks, but provides guarantees on the
  model behavior, which makes it easier to explain and debug.
