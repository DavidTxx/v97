abstract: Domain adaptation enables knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain
  to an unlabeled target domain. A mainstream approach is adversarial feature adaptation,
  which learns domain-invariant representations through aligning the feature distributions
  of both domains. However, a theoretical prerequisite of domain adaptation is the
  adaptability measured by the expected risk of an ideal joint hypothesis over the
  source and target domains. In this respect, adversarial feature adaptation may potentially
  deteriorate the adaptability, since it distorts the original feature distributions
  when suppressing domain-specific variations. To this end, we propose Transferable
  Adversarial Training (TAT) to enable the adaptation of deep classifiers. The approach
  generates transferable examples to fill in the gap between the source and target
  domains, and adversarially trains the deep classifiers to make consistent predictions
  over the transferable examples. Without learning domain-invariant representations
  at the expense of distorting the feature distributions, the adaptability in the
  theoretical learning bound is algorithmically guaranteed. A series of experiments
  validate that our approach advances the state of the arts on a variety of domain
  adaptation tasks in vision and NLP, including object recognition, learning from
  synthetic to real data, and sentiment classification.
