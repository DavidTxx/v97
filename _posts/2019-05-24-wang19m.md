abstract: In this paper, we study the sparse linear regression problem under the Local
  Differential Privacy (LDP) model. We first show that polynomial dependency on the
  dimensionality $p$ of the space is unavoidable for the estimation error in both
  non-interactive and sequential interactive local models, if the privacy of the whole
  dataset needs to be preserved. Similar limitations also exist for other types of
  error measurements and in the relaxed local models. This indicates that differential
  privacy in high dimensional space is unlikely achievable for the problem. With the
  understanding of this limitation, we then present two algorithmic results. The first
  one is a sequential interactive LDP algorithm for the low dimensional sparse case,
  called Locally Differentially Private Iterative Hard Thresholding (LDP-IHT), which
  achieves a near optimal upper bound. This algorithm is actually rather general and
  can be used to solve quite a few other problems, such as (Local) DP-ERM with sparsity
  constraints and sparse regression with non-linear measurements. The second one is
  for the restricted (high dimensional) case where only the privacy of the responses
  (labels) needs to be preserved. For this case, we show that the optimal rate of
  the error estimation can be made logarithmically depending on $p$ (i.e., $\log p$)
  in the local model, where an upper bound is obtained by a label-privacy version
  of LDP-IHT. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets confirm our theoretical
  analysis.
