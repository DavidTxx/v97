abstract: We clarify what fairness guarantees we can and cannot expect to follow from
  unconstrained machine learning. Specifically, we show that in many settings, unconstrained
  learning on its own implies group calibration, that is, the outcome variable is
  conditionally independent of group membership given the score. A lower bound confirms
  the optimality of our upper bound. Moreover, we prove that as the excess risk of
  the learned score decreases, the more strongly it violates separation and independence,
  two other standard fairness criteria. Our results challenge the view that group
  calibration necessitates an active intervention, suggesting that often we ought
  to think of it as a byproduct of unconstrained machine learning.
