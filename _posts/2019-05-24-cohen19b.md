abstract: We present the first computationally-efficient algorithm with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  regret for learning in Linear Quadratic Control systems with unknown dynamics. By
  that, we resolve an open question of Abbasi-Yadkori and Szepesvari (2011) and Dean,Mania,
  Matni, Recht, and Tu (2018).
