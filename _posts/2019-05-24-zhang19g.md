abstract: We introduce the Neural Collaborative Subspace Clustering, a neural model
  that discovers clusters of data points drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces.
  In contrast to previous attempts, our model runs without the aid of spectral clustering.
  This makes our algorithm one of the kinds that can gracefully scale to large datasets.
  At its heart, our neural model benefits from a classifier which determines whether
  a pair of points lies on the same subspace or not. Essential to our model is the
  construction of two affinity matrices, one from the classifier and the other from
  a notion of subspace self-expressiveness, to supervise training in a collaborative
  scheme. We thoroughly assess and contrast the performance of our model against various
  state-of-the-art clustering algorithms including deep subspace-based ones.
