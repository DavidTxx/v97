abstract: Recent literature has demonstrated promising results for training Generative
  Adversarial Networks by employing a set of discriminators, in contrast to the traditional
  game involving one generator against a single adversary. Such methods perform single-objective
  optimization on some simple consolidation of the losses, e.g. an arithmetic average.
  In this work, we revisit the multiple-discriminator setting by framing the simultaneous
  minimization of losses provided by different models as a multi-objective optimization
  problem. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of multiple gradient descent
  and the hypervolume maximization algorithm on a number of different datasets. Moreover,
  we argue that the previously proposed methods and hypervolume maximization can all
  be seen as variations of multiple gradient descent in which the update direction
  can be computed efficiently. Our results indicate that hypervolume maximization
  presents a better compromise between sample quality and computational cost than
  previous methods.
