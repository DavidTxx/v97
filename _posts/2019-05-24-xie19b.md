abstract: We present Zeno, a technique to make distributed machine learning, particularly
  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), tolerant to an arbitrary number of faulty workers.
  Zeno generalizes previous results that assumed a majority of non-faulty nodes; we
  need assume only one non-faulty worker. Our key idea is to suspect workers that
  are potentially defective. Since this is likely to lead to false positives, we use
  a ranking-based preference mechanism. We prove the convergence of SGD for non-convex
  problems under these scenarios. Experimental results show that Zeno outperforms
  existing approaches.
