abstract: While meta reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods have achieved remarkable
  success, obtaining correct and low variance estimates for policy gradients remains
  a significant challenge. In particular, estimating a large Hessian, poor sample
  efficiency and unstable training continue to make Meta-RL difficult. We propose
  a surrogate objective function named, Taming MAML (TMAML), that adds control variates
  into gradient estimation via automatic differentiation. TMAML improves the quality
  of gradient estimation by reducing variance without introducing bias. We further
  propose a version of our method that extends the meta-learning framework to learning
  the control variates themselves, enabling efficient and scalable learning from a
  distribution of MDPs. We empirically compare our approach with MAML and other variance-bias
  trade-off methods including DICE, LVC, and action-dependent control variates. Our
  approach is easy to implement and outperforms existing methods in terms of the variance
  and accuracy of gradient estimation, ultimately yielding higher performance across
  a variety of challenging Meta-RL environments.
