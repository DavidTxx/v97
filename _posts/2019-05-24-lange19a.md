abstract: We introduce block descent algorithms for projecting onto Minkowski sums
  of sets. Projection onto such sets is a crucial step in many statistical learning
  problems, and may regularize complexity of solutions to an optimization problem
  or arise in dual formulations of penalty methods. We show that projecting onto the
  Minkowski sum admits simple, efficient algorithms when complications such as overlapping
  constraints pose challenges to existing methods. We prove that our algorithm converges
  linearly when sets are strongly convex or satisfy an error bound condition, and
  extend the theory and methods to encompass non-convex sets as well. We demonstrate
  empirical advantages in runtime and accuracy over competitors in applications to
  $\ell_{1,p}$-regularized learning, constrained lasso, and overlapping group lasso.
