abstract: 'Many reinforcement learning (RL) tasks provide the agent with high-dimensional
  observations that can be simplified into low-dimensional continuous states. To formalize
  this process, we introduce the concept of a \texit{DeepMDP}, a parameterized latent
  space model that is trained via the minimization of two tractable latent space losses:
  prediction of rewards and prediction of the distribution over next latent states.
  We show that the optimization of these objectives guarantees (1) the quality of
  the embedding function as a representation of the state space and (2) the quality
  of the DeepMDP as a model of the environment. Our theoretical findings are substantiated
  by the experimental result that a trained DeepMDP recovers the latent structure
  underlying high-dimensional observations on a synthetic environment. Finally, we
  show that learning a DeepMDP as an auxiliary task in the Atari 2600 domain leads
  to large performance improvements over model-free RL.'
