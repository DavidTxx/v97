abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel approach to imitation learning that infers
  latent policies directly from state observations. We introduce a method that characterizes
  the causal effects of latent actions on observations while simultaneously predicting
  their likelihood. We then outline an action alignment procedure that leverages a
  small amount of environment interactions to determine a mapping between the latent
  and real-world actions. We show that this corrected labeling can be used for imitating
  the observed behavior, even though no expert actions are given. We evaluate our
  approach within classic control environments and a platform game and demonstrate
  that it performs better than standard approaches. Code for this work is available
  at https://github.com/ashedwards/ILPO.
