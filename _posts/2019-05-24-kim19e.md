abstract: We derive concentration inequalities for the supremum norm of the difference
  between a kernel density estimator (KDE) and its point-wise expectation that hold
  uniformly over the selection of the bandwidth and under weaker conditions on the
  kernel and the data generating distribution than previously used in the literature.
  We first propose a novel concept, called the volume dimension, to measure the intrinsic
  dimension of the support of a probability distribution based on the rates of decay
  of the probability of vanishing Euclidean balls. Our bounds depend on the volume
  dimension and generalize the existing bounds derived in the literature. In particular,
  when the data-generating distribution has a bounded Lebesgue density or is supported
  on a sufficiently well-behaved lower-dimensional manifold, our bound recovers the
  same convergence rate depending on the intrinsic dimension of the support as ones
  known in the literature. At the same time, our results apply to more general cases,
  such as the ones of distribution with unbounded densities or supported on a mixture
  of manifolds with different dimensions. Analogous bounds are derived for the derivative
  of the KDE, of any order. Our results are generally applicable but are especially
  useful for problems in geometric inference and topological data analysis, including
  level set estimation, density-based clustering, modal clustering and mode hunting,
  ridge estimation and persistent homology.
