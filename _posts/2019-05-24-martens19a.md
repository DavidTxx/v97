abstract: The interpretation of complex high-dimensional data typically requires the
  use of dimensionality reduction techniques to extract explanatory low-dimensional
  representations. However, in many real-world problems these representations may
  not be sufficient to aid interpretation on their own, and it would be desirable
  to interpret the model in terms of the original features themselves. Our goal is
  to characterise how feature-level variation depends on latent low-dimensional representations,
  external covariates, and non-linear interactions between the two. In this paper,
  we propose to achieve this through a structured kernel decomposition in a hybrid
  Gaussian Process model which we call the Covariate Gaussian Process Latent Variable
  Model (c-GPLVM). We demonstrate the utility of our model on simulated examples and
  applications in disease progression modelling from high-dimensional gene expression
  data in the presence of additional phenotypes. In each setting we show how the c-GPLVM
  can extract low-dimensional structures from high-dimensional data sets whilst allowing
  a breakdown of feature-level variability that is not present in other commonly used
  dimensionality reduction approaches.
