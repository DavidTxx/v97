abstract: Learning high-quality node embeddings is a key building block for machine
  learning models that operate on graph data, such as social networks and recommender
  systems. However, existing graph embedding techniques are unable to cope with fairness
  constraints, e.g., ensuring that the learned representations do not correlate with
  certain attributes, such as age or gender. Here, we introduce an adversarial framework
  to enforce fairness constraints on graph embeddings. Our approach is <em>compositional</em>â€”meaning
  that it can flexibly accommodate different combinations of fairness constraints
  during inference. For instance, in the context of social recommendations, our framework
  would allow one user to request that their recommendations are invariant to both
  their age and gender, while also allowing another user to request invariance to
  just their age. Experiments on standard knowledge graph and recommender system benchmarks
  highlight the utility of our proposed framework.
