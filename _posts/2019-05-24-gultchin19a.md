abstract: 'While humor is often thought to be beyond the reach of Natural Language
  Processing, we show that several aspects of single-word humor correlate with simple
  linear directions in Word Embeddings. In particular: (a) the word vectors capture
  multiple aspects discussed in humor theories from various disciplines; (b) each
  individual’s sense of humor can be represented by a vector, which can predict differences
  in people’s senses of humor on new, unrated, words; and (c) upon clustering humor
  ratings of multiple demographic groups, different humor preferences emerge across
  the different groups. Humor ratings are taken from the work of Engelthaler and Hills
  (2017) as well as from an original crowdsourcing study of 120,000 words. Our dataset
  further includes annotations for the theoretically-motivated humor features we identify.'
