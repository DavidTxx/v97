abstract: We propose the labeled Cech complex, the plain labeled Vietoris-Rips complex,
  and the locally scaled labeled Vietoris-Rips complex to perform persistent homology
  inference of decision boundaries in classification tasks. We provide theoretical
  conditions and analysis for recovering the homology of a decision boundary from
  samples. Our main objective is quantification of deep neural network complexity
  to enable matching of datasets to pre-trained models to facilitate the functioning
  of AI marketplaces; we report results for experiments using MNIST, FashionMNIST,
  and CIFAR10.
