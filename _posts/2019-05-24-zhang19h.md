abstract: Randomized sketching has been used in offline kernel learning, but it cannot
  be applied directly to online kernel learning due to the lack of incremental maintenances
  for randomized sketches with regret guarantees. To address these issues, we propose
  a novel incremental randomized sketching approach for online kernel learning, which
  has efficient incremental maintenances with theoretical guarantees. We construct
  two incremental randomized sketches using the sparse transform matrix and the sampling
  matrix for kernel matrix approximation, update the incremental randomized sketches
  using rank-$1$ modifications, and construct an time-varying explicit feature mapping
  for online kernel learning. We prove that the proposed incremental randomized sketching
  is statistically unbiased for the matrix product approximation, obtains a $1 + \epsilon$
  relative-error bound for the kernel matrix approximation, enjoys a sublinear regret
  bound for online kernel learning, and has constant time and space complexities at
  each round for incremental maintenances. Experimental results demonstrate that the
  incremental randomized sketching achieves a better learning performance in terms
  of accuracy and efficiency even in adversarial environments.
