abstract: 'Recent work has documented the susceptibility of deep learning systems
  to adversarial examples, but most such attacks directly manipulate the digital input
  to a classifier. Although a smaller line of work considers physical adversarial
  attacks, in all cases these involve manipulating the object of interest, e.g., putting
  a physical sticker on an object to misclassify it, or manufacturing an object specifically
  intended to be misclassified. In this work, we consider an alternative question:
  is it possible to fool deep classifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain
  type, by physically manipulating the camera itself? We show that by placing a carefully
  crafted and mainly-translucent sticker over the lens of a camera, one can create
  universal perturbations of the observed images that are inconspicuous, yet misclassify
  target objects as a different (targeted) class. To accomplish this, we propose an
  iterative procedure for both updating the attack perturbation (to make it adversarial
  for a given classifier), and the threat model itself (to ensure it is physically
  realizable). For example, we show that we can achieve physically-realizable attacks
  that fool ImageNet classifiers in a targeted fashion 49.6% of the time. This presents
  a new class of physically-realizable threat models to consider in the context of
  adversarially robust machine learning. Our demo video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/wUVmL33Fx54'
