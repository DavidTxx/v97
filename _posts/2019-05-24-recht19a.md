abstract: We build new test sets for the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Both benchmarks
  have been the focus of intense research for almost a decade, raising the danger
  of overfitting to excessively re-used test sets. By closely following the original
  dataset creation processes, we test to what extent current classification models
  generalize to new data. We evaluate a broad range of models and find accuracy drops
  of 3% - 15% on CIFAR-10 and 11% - 14% on ImageNet. However, accuracy gains on the
  original test sets translate to larger gains on the new test sets. Our results suggest
  that the accuracy drops are not caused by adaptivity, but by the modelsâ€™ inability
  to generalize to slightly "harder" images than those found in the original test
  sets.
