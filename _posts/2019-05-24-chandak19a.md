abstract: Most model-free reinforcement learning methods leverage state representations
  (embeddings) for generalization, but either ignore structure in the space of actions
  or assume the structure is provided a priori. We show how a policy can be decomposed
  into a component that acts in a low-dimensional space of action representations
  and a component that transforms these representations into actual actions. These
  representations improve generalization over large, finite action sets by allowing
  the agent to infer the outcomes of actions similar to actions already taken. We
  provide an algorithm to both learn and use action representations and provide conditions
  for its convergence. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on large-scale
  real-world problems.
