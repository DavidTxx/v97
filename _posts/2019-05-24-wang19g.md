abstract: Reducing the test time resource requirements of a neural network while preserving
  test accuracy is crucial for running inference on resource-constrained devices.
  To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel network reparameterization based on the
  Kronecker-factored eigenbasis (KFE), and then apply Hessian-based structured pruning
  methods in this basis. As opposed to existing Hessian-based pruning algorithms which
  do pruning in parameter coordinates, our method works in the KFE where different
  weights are approximately independent, enabling accurate pruning and fast computation.
  We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive
  experiments. In particular, we highlight that the improvements are especially significant
  for more challenging datasets and networks. With negligible loss of accuracy, an
  iterative-pruning version gives a 10x reduction in model size and a 8x reduction
  in FLOPs on wide ResNet32.
