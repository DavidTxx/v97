abstract: Predictive performance of machine learning algorithms on related problems
  can be improved using multitask learning approaches. Rather than performing survival
  analysis on each data set to predict survival times of cancer patients, we developed
  a novel multitask approach based on multiple kernel learning (MKL). Our multitask
  MKL algorithm both works on multiple cancer data sets and integrates cancer-related
  pathways/gene sets into survival analysis. We tested our algorithm, which is named
  as Path2MSurv, on the Cancer Genome Atlas data sets analyzing gene expression profiles
  of 7,655 patients from 20 cancer types together with cancer-specific pathway/gene
  set collections. Path2MSurv obtained better or comparable predictive performance
  when benchmarked against random survival forest, survival support vector machine,
  and single-task variant of our algorithm. Path2MSurv has the ability to identify
  key pathways/gene sets in predicting survival times of patients from different cancer
  types.
