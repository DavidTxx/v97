abstract: 'Events in the world may be caused by other, unobserved events. We consider
  sequences of events in continuous time. Given a probability model of complete sequences,
  we propose particle smoothing—a form of sequential importance sampling—to impute
  the missing events in an incomplete sequence. We develop a trainable family of proposal
  distributions based on a type of bidirectional continuous-time LSTM: Bidirectionality
  lets the proposals condition on future observations, not just on the past as in
  particle filtering. Our method can sample an ensemble of possible complete sequences
  (particles), from which we form a single consensus prediction that has low Bayes
  risk under our chosen loss metric. We experiment in multiple synthetic and real
  domains, using different missingness mechanisms, and modeling the complete sequences
  in each domain with a neural Hawkes process (Mei & Eisner 2017). On held-out incomplete
  sequences, our method is effective at inferring the ground-truth unobserved events,
  with particle smoothing consistently improving upon particle filtering.'
