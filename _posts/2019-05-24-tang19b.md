abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are capable of learning latent representations
  for high dimensional data. However, due to the i.i.d. assumption, VAEs only optimize
  the singleton variational distributions and fail to account for the correlations
  between data points, which might be crucial for learning latent representations
  from dataset where a priori we know correlations exist. We propose Correlated Variational
  Auto-Encoders (CVAEs) that can take the correlation structure into consideration
  when learning latent representations with VAEs. CVAEs apply a prior based on the
  correlation structure. To address the intractability introduced by the correlated
  prior, we develop an approximation by average of a set of tractable lower bounds
  over all maximal acyclic subgraphs of the undirected correlation graph. Experimental
  results on matching and link prediction on public benchmark rating datasets and
  spectral clustering on a synthetic dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
  method over baseline algorithms.
