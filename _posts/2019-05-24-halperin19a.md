abstract: Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine
  learning and signal processing. Most current methods either rely on making strong
  assumptions on the source distributions or rely on having training samples of each
  source in the mixture. In this work, we introduce a new method—Neural Egg Separation—to
  tackle the scenario of extracting a signal from an unobserved distribution additively
  mixed with a signal from an observed distribution. Our method iteratively learns
  to separate the known distribution from progressively finer estimates of the unknown
  distribution. In some settings, Neural Egg Separation is initialization sensitive,
  we therefore introduce Latent Mixture Masking which ensures a good initialization.
  Extensive experiments on audio and image separation tasks show that our method outperforms
  current methods that use the same level of supervision, and often achieves similar
  performance to full supervision.
