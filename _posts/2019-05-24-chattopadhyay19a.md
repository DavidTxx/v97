abstract: We propose a new attribution method for neural networks developed using
  ﬁrst principles of causality (to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst such). The
  neural network architecture is viewed as a Structural Causal Model, and a methodology
  to compute the causal effect of each feature on the output is presented. With reasonable
  assumptions on the causal structure of the input data, we propose algorithms to
  efﬁciently compute the causal effects, as well as scale the approach to data with
  large dimensionality. We also show how this method can be used for recurrent neural
  networks. We report experimental results on both simulated and real datasets showcasing
  the promise and usefulness of the proposed algorithm.
