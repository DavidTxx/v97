abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have experienced
  significant attention and have become the de facto methods for learning graph representations.
  GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a
  result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation. In this paper,
  we reduce this excess complexity through successively removing nonlinearities and
  collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. We theoretically analyze
  the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter
  followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates
  that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream
  applications. Moreover, the resulting model scales to larger datasets, is naturally
  interpretable, and yields up to two orders of magnitude speedup over FastGCN.
