abstract: This work studies the robustness certification problem of neural network
  models, which aims to find certified adversary-free regions as large as possible
  around data points. In contrast to the existing approaches that seek regions bounded
  uniformly along all input features, we consider non-uniform bounds and use it to
  study the decision boundary of neural network models. We formulate our target as
  an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. Then, a framework applicable
  for general feedforward neural networks is proposed to bound the output logits so
  that the relaxed problem can be solved by the augmented Lagrangian method. Our experiments
  show the non-uniform bounds have larger volumes than uniform ones. Compared with
  normal models, the robust models have even larger non-uniform bounds and better
  interpretability. Further, the geometric similarity of the non-uniform bounds gives
  a quantitative, data-agnostic metric of input featuresâ€™ robustness.
