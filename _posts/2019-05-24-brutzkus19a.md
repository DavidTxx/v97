abstract: When applying machine learning to sensitive data, one has to find a balance
  between accuracy, information security, and computational-complexity. Recent studies
  combined Homomorphic Encryption with neural networks to make inferences while protecting
  against information leakage. However, these methods are limited by the width and
  depth of neural networks that can be used (and hence the accuracy) and exhibit high
  latency even for relatively simple networks. In this study we provide two solutions
  that address these limitations. In the first solution, we present more than 10\times
  improvement in latency and enable inference on wider networks compared to prior
  attempts with the same level of security. The improved performance is achieved by
  novel methods to represent the data during the computation. In the second solution,
  we apply the method of transfer learning to provide private inference services using
  deep networks with latency of \sim0.16 seconds. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
  methods on several computer vision tasks.
