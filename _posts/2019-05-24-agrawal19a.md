abstract: 'Discovering interaction effects on a response of interest is a fundamental
  problem faced in biology, medicine, economics, and many other scientific disciplines.
  In theory, Bayesian methods for discovering pairwise interactions enjoy many benefits
  such as coherent uncertainty quantification, the ability to incorporate background
  knowledge, and desirable shrinkage properties. In practice, however, Bayesian methods
  are often computationally intractable for even moderate- dimensional problems. Our
  key insight is that many hierarchical models of practical interest admit a Gaussian
  process representation such that rather than maintaining a posterior over all O(p^2)
  interactions, we need only maintain a vector of O(p) kernel hyper-parameters. This
  implicit representation allows us to run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) over model
  hyper-parameters in time and memory linear in p per iteration. We focus on sparsity-inducing
  models and show on datasets with a variety of covariate behaviors that our method:
  (1) reduces runtime by orders of magnitude over naive applications of MCMC, (2)
  provides lower Type I and Type II error relative to state-of-the-art LASSO-based
  approaches, and (3) offers improved computational scaling in high dimensions relative
  to existing Bayesian and LASSO-based approaches.'
