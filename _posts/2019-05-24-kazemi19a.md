abstract: Streaming algorithms are generally judged by the quality of their solution,
  memory footprint, and computational complexity. In this paper, we study the problem
  of maximizing a monotone submodular function in the streaming setting with a cardinality
  constraint $k$. We first propose SIEVE-STREAMING++, which requires just one pass
  over the data, keeps only $O(k)$ elements and achieves the tight $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation
  guarantee. The best previously known streaming algorithms either achieve a suboptimal
  $\frac{1}{4}$-approximation with $\Theta(k)$ memory or the optimal $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation
  with $O(k\log k)$ memory. Next, we show that by buffering a small fraction of the
  stream and applying a careful filtering procedure, one can heavily reduce the number
  of adaptive computational rounds, thus substantially lowering the computational
  complexity of SIEVE-STREAMING++. We then generalize our results to the more challenging
  multi-source streaming setting. We show how one can achieve the tight $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation
  guarantee with $O(k)$ shared memory, while minimizing not only the rounds of computations
  but also the total number of communicated bits. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency
  of our algorithms on real-world data summarization tasks for multi-source streams
  of tweets and of YouTube videos.
