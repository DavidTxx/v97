abstract: Composing skills mastered in one task to solve novel tasks promises dramatic
  improvements in the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. Here, we analyze
  two recent works composing behaviors represented in the form of action-value functions
  and show that they perform poorly in some situations. As part of this analysis,
  we extend an important generalization of policy improvement to the maximum entropy
  framework and introduce an algorithm for the practical implementation of successor
  features in continuous action spaces. Then we propose a novel approach which addresses
  the failure cases of prior work and, in principle, recovers the optimal policy during
  transfer. This method works by explicitly learning the (discounted, future) divergence
  between base policies. We study this approach in the tabular case and on non-trivial
  continuous control problems with compositional structure and show that it outperforms
  or matches existing methods across all tasks considered.
