abstract: In a recent study, Friedler et al. pointed out that several fair classification
  algorithms are not stable with respect to variations in the training set â€“ a crucial
  consideration in several applications. Motivated by their work, we study the problem
  of designing classification algorithms that are both fair and stable. We propose
  an extended framework based on fair classification algorithms that are formulated
  as optimization problems, by introducing a stability-focused regularization term.
  Theoretically, we prove an additional stability guarantee, that was lacking in fair
  classification algorithms, and also provide an accuracy guarantee for our extended
  framework. Our accuracy guarantee can be used to inform the selection of the regularization
  parameter in our framework. We assess the benefits of our approach empirically by
  extending several fair classification algorithms that are shown to achieve the best
  balance between fairness and accuracy over the \textbf{Adult} dataset. Our empirical
  results show that our extended framework indeed improves the stability at only a
  slight sacrifice in accuracy.
