abstract: We consider the problem of handling missing data with deep latent variable
  models (DLVMs). First, we present a simple technique to train DLVMs when the training
  set contains missing-at-random data. Our approach, called MIWAE, is based on the
  importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE), and maximises a potentially tight lower
  bound of the log-likelihood of the observed data. Compared to the original IWAE,
  our algorithm does not induce any additional computational overhead due to the missing
  data. We also develop Monte Carlo techniques for single and multiple imputation
  using a DLVM trained on an incomplete data set. We illustrate our approach by training
  a convolutional DLVM on incomplete static binarisations of MNIST. Moreover, on various
  continuous data sets, we show that MIWAE provides extremely accurate single imputations,
  and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods.
