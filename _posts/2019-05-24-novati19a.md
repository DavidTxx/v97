abstract: Experience replay (ER) is a fundamental component of off-policy deep reinforcement
  learning (RL). ER recalls experiences from past iterations to compute gradient estimates
  for the current policy, increasing data-efficiency. However, the accuracy of such
  updates may deteriorate when the policy diverges from past behaviors and can undermine
  the performance of ER. Many algorithms mitigate this issue by tuning hyper-parameters
  to slow down policy changes. An alternative is to actively enforce the similarity
  between policy and the experiences in the replay memory. We introduce Remember and
  Forget Experience Replay (ReF-ER), a novel method that can enhance RL algorithms
  with parameterized policies. ReF-ER (1) skips gradients computed from experiences
  that are too unlikely with the current policy and (2) regulates policy changes within
  a trust region of the replayed behaviors. We couple ReF-ER with Q-learning, deterministic
  policy gradient and off-policy gradient methods. We find that ReF-ER consistently
  improves the performance of continuous-action, off-policy RL on fully observable
  benchmarks and partially observable flow control problems.
