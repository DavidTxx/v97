abstract: Recurrent neural networks are a widely used class of neural architectures
  with two shortcomings. First, it is difficult to understand what exactly they learn.
  Second, they tend to work poorly on sequences requiring long-term memorization,
  despite having this capacity in principle. We aim to address both shortcomings with
  a class of recurrent networks that use a stochastic state transition mechanism between
  cell applications. This mechanism, which we term state-regularization, makes RNNs
  transition between a finite set of learnable states. We evaluate state-regularized
  RNNs on (1) regular languages for the purpose of automata extraction; (2) nonregular
  languages such as balanced parentheses, palindromes, and the copy task where external
  memory is required; and (3) real-word sequence learning tasks for sentiment analysis,
  visual object recognition, and language modeling. We show that state-regularization
  simplifies the extraction of finite state automata from the RNNâ€™s state transition
  dynamics; forces RNNs to operate more like automata with external memory and less
  like finite state machines; and makes RNNs more interpretable.
