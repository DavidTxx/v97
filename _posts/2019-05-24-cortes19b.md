abstract: We present two novel enhancements of an online importance-weighted active
  learning algorithm IWAL, using the properties of disagreements among hypotheses.
  The first enhancement, IWALD, prunes the hypothesis set with a more aggressive strategy
  based on the disagreement graph. We show that IWAL-D improves the generalization
  performance and the label complexity of the original IWAL, and quantify the improvement
  in terms of the disagreement graph coefficient. The second enhancement, IZOOM, further
  improves IWAL-D by adaptively zooming into the current version space and thus reducing
  the best-in-class error. We show that IZOOM admits favorable theoretical guarantees
  with the changing hypothesis set. We report experimental results on multiple datasets
  and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve better test performances than
  IWAL given the same amount of labeling budget.
