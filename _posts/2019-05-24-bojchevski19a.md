abstract: The goal of network representation learning is to learn low-dimensional
  node embeddings that capture the graph structure and are useful for solving downstream
  tasks. However, despite the proliferation of such methods, there is currently no
  study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. We provide the first adversarial
  vulnerability analysis on the widely used family of methods based on random walks.
  We derive efficient adversarial perturbations that poison the network structure
  and have a negative effect on both the quality of the embeddings and the downstream
  tasks. We further show that our attacks are transferable since they generalize to
  many models and are successful even when the attacker is restricted.
