abstract: We provide the first mathematically complete derivation of the Nystr{ö}m
  method for low-rank approximation of indefinite kernels and propose an efficient
  method for finding an approximate eigendecomposition of such kernel matrices. Building
  on this result, we devise highly scalable methods for learning in reproducing kernel
  Krein spaces. The devised approaches provide a principled and theoretically well-founded
  means to tackle large scale learning problems with indefinite kernels. The main
  motivation for our work comes from problems with structured representations (e.g.,
  graphs, strings, time-series), where it is relatively easy to devise a pairwise
  (dis)similarity function based on intuition and/or knowledge of domain experts.
  Such functions are typically not positive definite and it is often well beyond the
  expertise of practitioners to verify this condition. The effectiveness of the devised
  approaches is evaluated empirically using indefinite kernels defined on structured
  and vectorial data representations.
