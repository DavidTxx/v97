abstract: How can one perform Bayesian inference on stochastic simulators with intractable
  likelihoods? A recent approach is to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed
  simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. However,
  existing methods are limited to a narrow range of proposal distributions or require
  importance weighting that can limit performance in practice. Here we present automatic
  posterior transformation (APT), a new sequential neural posterior estimation method
  for simulation-based inference. APT can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary,
  dynamically updated proposals, and is compatible with powerful flow-based density
  estimators. It is more flexible, scalable and efficient than previous simulation-based
  inference techniques. APT can operate directly on high-dimensional time series and
  image data, opening up new applications for likelihood-free inference.
