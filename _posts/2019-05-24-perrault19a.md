abstract: We improve the efficiency of algorithms for stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits.
  In most interesting problems, state-of-the-art algorithms take advantage of structural
  properties of rewards, such as independence. However, while being minimax optimal
  in terms of regret, these algorithms are intractable. In our paper, we first reduce
  their implementation to a specific submodular maximization. Then, in case of matroid
  constraints, we design adapted approximation routines, thereby providing the first
  efficient algorithms that exploit the reward structure. In particular, we improve
  the state-of-the-art efficient gap-free regret bound by a factor sqrt(k), where
  k is the maximum action size. Finally, we show how our improvement translates to
  more general budgeted combinatorial semi-bandits.
