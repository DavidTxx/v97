abstract: The apparent contradiction in the title is a wordplay on the different meanings
  attributed to the word reproducible across different scientific fields. What we
  imply is that unreproducible findings can be built upon reproducible methods. Without
  denying the importance of facilitating the reproduction of methods, we deem important
  to reassert that reproduction of findings is a fundamental step of the scientific
  inquiry. We argue that the commendable quest towards easy deterministic reproducibility
  of methods and numerical results should not have us forget the even more important
  necessity of ensuring the reproducibility of empirical findings and conclusions
  by properly accounting for essential sources of variations. We provide experiments
  to exemplify the brittleness of current common practice in the evaluation of models
  in the field of deep learning, showing that even if the results could be reproduced,
  a slightly different experiment would not support the findings. We hope to help
  clarify the distinction between exploratory and empirical research in the field
  of deep learning and believe more energy should be devoted to proper empirical research
  in our community. This work is an attempt to promote the use of more rigorous and
  diversified methodologies. It is not an attempt to impose a new methodology and
  it is not a critique on the nature of exploratory research.
