abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has played a central role in machine learning.
  However, it requires a carefully hand-picked stepsize for fast convergence, which
  is notoriously tedious and time-consuming to tune. Over the last several years,
  a plethora of adaptive gradient-based algorithms have emerged to ameliorate this
  problem. In this paper, we propose new surrogate losses to cast the problem of learning
  the optimal stepsizes for the stochastic optimization of a non-convex smooth objective
  function onto an online convex optimization problem. This allows the use of no-regret
  online algorithms to compute optimal stepsizes on the fly. In turn, this results
  in a SGD algorithm with self-tuned stepsizes that guarantees convergence rates that
  are automatically adaptive to the level of noise.
