abstract: In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of clustering based on
  the kernel normalized cut. Our first contribution is to derive a nonasymptotic upper
  bound on the expected distortion rate of the kernel normalized cut. From this result,
  we show that the solution of the kernel normalized cut converges to that of the
  population-level weighted k-means clustering on a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space (RKHS). Our second contribution is the discover of the interesting fact that
  the population-level weighted k-means clustering in the RKHS is equivalent to the
  population-level normalized cut. Combining these results, we can see that the kernel
  normalized cut converges to the population-level normalized cut. The criterion of
  the population-level normalized cut can be considered as an indivisibility of the
  population distribution, and this criterion plays an important role in the theoretical
  analysis of spectral clustering in Schiebinger et al. (2015). We believe that our
  results will provide deep insights into the behavior of both normalized cut and
  spectral clustering.
