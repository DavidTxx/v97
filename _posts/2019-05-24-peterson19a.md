abstract: 'Human decision-making underlies all economic behavior. For the past four
  decades, human decision-making under uncertainty has continued to be explained by
  theoretical models based on prospect theory, a framework that was awarded the Nobel
  Prize in Economic Sciences. However, theoretical models of this kind have developed
  slowly, and robust, high-precision predictive models of human decisions remain a
  challenge. While machine learning is a natural candidate for solving these problems,
  it is currently unclear to what extent it can improve predictions obtained by current
  theories. We argue that this is mainly due to data scarcity, since noisy human behavior
  requires massive sample sizes to be accurately captured by off-the-shelf machine
  learning methods. To solve this problem, what is needed are machine learning models
  with appropriate inductive biases for capturing human behavior, and larger datasets.
  We offer two contributions towards this end: first, we construct “cognitive model
  priors” by pretraining neural networks with synthetic data generated by cognitive
  models (i.e., theoretical models developed by cognitive psychologists). We find
  that fine-tuning these networks on small datasets of real human decisions results
  in unprecedented state-of-the-art improvements on two benchmark datasets. Second,
  we present the first large-scale dataset for human decision-making, containing over
  240,000 human judgments across over 13,000 decision problems. This dataset reveals
  the circumstances where cognitive model priors are useful, and provides a new standard
  for benchmarking prediction of human decisions under uncertainty.'
