abstract: We present a Bayesian view of counterfactual risk minimization (CRM) for
  offline learning from logged bandit feedback. Using PAC-Bayesian analysis, we derive
  a new generalization bound for the truncated inverse propensity score estimator.
  We apply the bound to a class of Bayesian policies, which motivates a novel, potentially
  data-dependent, regularization technique for CRM. Experimental results indicate
  that this technique outperforms standard $L_2$ regularization, and that it is competitive
  with variance regularization while being both simpler to implement and more computationally
  efficient.
