abstract: Data augmentation (DA) is commonly used during model training, as it significantly
  improves test error and model robustness. DA artificially expands the training set
  by applying random noise, rotations, crops, or even adversarial perturbations to
  the input data. Although DA is widely used, its capacity to provably improve robustness
  is not fully understood. In this work, we analyze the robustness that DA begets
  by quantifying the margin that DA enforces on empirical risk minimizers. We first
  focus on linear separators, and then a class of nonlinear models whose labeling
  is constant within small convex hulls of data points. We present lower bounds on
  the number of augmented data points required for non-zero margin, and show that
  commonly used DA techniques may only introduce significant margin after adding exponentially
  many points to the data set.
