abstract: We consider estimating a high-dimensional vector from non-linear measurements
  where the unknown vector is represented by a generative model $G:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$
  with $k\ll d$. Such a model poses structural priors on the unknown vector without
  having a dedicated basis, and in particular allows new and efficient approaches
  solving recovery problems with number of measurements far less than the ambient
  dimension of the vector. While progresses have been made recently regarding theoretical
  understandings on the linear Gaussian measurements, much less is known when the
  model is possibly misspecified and the measurements are non-Gaussian. In this paper,
  we make a step towards such a direction by considering the scenario where the measurements
  are non-Gaussian, subject to possibly unknown nonlinear transformations and the
  responses are heavy-tailed. We then propose new estimators via score functions based
  on the first and second order Steinâ€™s identity, and prove the sample size bound
  of $m=\mathcal{O}(k\varepsilon^{-2}\log(L/\varepsilon))$ achieving an $\varepsilon$
  error in the form of exponential concentration inequalities. Furthermore, for the
  special case of multi-layer ReLU generative model, we improve the sample bound by
  a logarithm factor to $m=\mathcal{O}(k\varepsilon^{-2}\log(d))$, matching the state-of-art
  statistical rate in compressed sensing for estimating $k$-sparse vectors. On the
  technical side, we develop new chaining methods bounding heavy-tailed processes,
  which could be of independent interest.
