abstract: We investigate online convex optimization in changing environments, and
  choose the adaptive regret as the performance measure. The goal is to achieve a
  small regret over every interval so that the comparator is allowed to change over
  time. Different from previous works that only utilize the convexity condition, this
  paper further exploits smoothness to improve the adaptive regret. To this end, we
  develop novel adaptive algorithms for convex and smooth functions, and establish
  problem-dependent regret bounds over any interval. Our regret bounds are comparable
  to existing results in the worst case, and become much tighter when the comparator
  has a small loss.
