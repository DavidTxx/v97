abstract: 'In the context of individual-level causal inference, we study the problem
  of predicting whether someone will respond or not to a treatment based on their
  features and past examples of features, treatment indicator (e.g., drug/no drug),
  and a binary outcome (e.g., recovery from disease). As a classification task, the
  problem is made difficult by not knowing the example outcomes under the opposite
  treatment indicators. We assume the effect is monotonic, as in advertising’s effect
  on a purchase or bail-setting’s effect on reappearance in court: either it would
  have happened regardless of treatment, not happened regardless, or happened only
  depending on exposure to treatment. Predicting whether the latter is latently the
  case is our focus. While previous work focuses on conditional average treatment
  effect estimation, formulating the problem as a classification task allows us to
  develop new tools more suited to this problem. By leveraging monotonicity, we develop
  new discriminative and generative algorithms for the responder-classification problem.
  We explore and discuss connections to corrupted data and policy learning. We provide
  an empirical study with both synthetic and real datasets to compare these specialized
  algorithms to standard benchmarks.'
