abstract: We present a non-parametric Bayesian latent variable model capable of learning
  dependency structures across dimensions in a multivariate setting. Our approach
  is based on flexible Gaussian process priors for the generative mappings and interchangeable
  Dirichlet process priors to learn the structure. The introduction of the Dirichlet
  process as a specific structural prior allows our model to circumvent issues associated
  with previous Gaussian process latent variable models. Inference is performed by
  deriving an efficient variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the model.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach via analysis of discovered structure
  and superior quantitative performance on missing data imputation.
