abstract: We characterize a prevalent weakness of deep neural networks (DNNs), ’overthinking’,
  which occurs when a DNN can reach correct predictions before its final layer. Overthinking
  is computationally wasteful, and it can also be destructive when, by the final layer,
  a correct prediction changes into a misclassification. Understanding overthinking
  requires studying how each prediction evolves during a DNN’s forward pass, which
  conventionally is opaque. For prediction transparency, we propose the Shallow-Deep
  Network (SDN), a generic modification to off-the-shelf DNNs that introduces internal
  classifiers. We apply SDN to four modern architectures, trained on three image classification
  tasks, to characterize the overthinking problem. We show that SDNs can mitigate
  the wasteful effect of overthinking with confidence-based early exits, which reduce
  the average inference cost by more than 50% and preserve the accuracy. We also find
  that the destructive effect occurs for 50% of misclassifications on natural inputs
  and that it can be induced, adversarially, with a recent backdooring attack. To
  mitigate this effect, we propose a new confusion metric to quantify the internal
  disagreements that will likely to lead to misclassifications.
