abstract: We study the Gibbs sampling algorithm for discrete and continuous $k$-determinantal
  point processes. We show that in both cases, the spectral gap of the chain is bounded
  by a polynomial of $k$ and it is independent of the size of the domain. As an immediate
  corollary, we obtain sublinear time algorithms for sampling from discrete $k$-DPPs
  given access to polynomially many processors. In the continuous setting, our result
  leads to the first class of rigorously analyzed efficient algorithms to generate
  random samples of continuous $k$-DPPs. We achieve this by showing that the Gibbs
  sampler for a large family of continuous $k$-DPPs can be simulated efficiently when
  the spectrum is not concentrated on the top $k$ eigenvalues.
