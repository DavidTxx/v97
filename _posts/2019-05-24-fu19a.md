abstract: Q-learning methods are a common class of algorithms used in reinforcement
  learning (RL). However, their behavior with function approximation, especially with
  neural networks, is poorly understood theoretically and empirically. In this work,
  we aim to experimentally investigate potential issues in Q-learning, by means of
  a "unit testing" framework where we can utilize oracles to disentangle sources of
  error. Specifically, we investigate questions related to function approximation,
  sampling error and nonstationarity, and where available, verify if trends found
  in oracle settings hold true with deep RL methods. We find that large neural network
  architectures have many benefits with regards to learning stability; offer several
  practical compensations for overfitting; and develop a novel sampling method based
  on explicitly compensating for function approximation error that yields fair improvement
  on high-dimensional continuous control domains.
