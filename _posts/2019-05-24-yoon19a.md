abstract: Handling previously unseen tasks after given only a few training examples
  continues to be a tough challenge in machine learning. We propose TapNets, neural
  networks augmented with task-adaptive projection for improved few-shot learning.
  Here, employing a meta-learning strategy with episode-based training, a network
  and a set of per-class reference vectors are learned across widely varying tasks.
  At the same time, for every episode, features in the embedding space are linearly
  projected into a new space as a form of quick task-specific conditioning. The training
  loss is obtained based on a distance metric between the query and the reference
  vectors in the projection space. Excellent generalization results in this way. When
  tested on the Omniglot, miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, we obtain state
  of the art classification accuracies under various few-shot scenarios.
