abstract: Learning distances that operate directly on multi-dimensional sequences
  is challenging because such distances are structural by nature and the vectors in
  sequences are not independent. Generally, distances for sequences heavily depend
  on the ground metric between the vectors in sequences. We propose to learn the distance
  for sequences through learning a ground Mahalanobis metric for the vectors in sequences.
  The learning samples are sequences of vectors for which how the ground metric between
  vectors induces the overall distance is given, and the objective is that the distance
  induced by the learned ground metric produces large values for sequences from different
  classes and small values for those from the same class. We formulate the metric
  as a parameter of the distance, bring closer each sequence to an associated virtual
  sequence w.r.t. the distance to reduce the number of constraints, and develop a
  general iterative solution for any ground-metric-based sequence distance. Experiments
  on several sequence datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
  method.
