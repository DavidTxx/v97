abstract: In order to integrate uncertainty estimates into deep time-series modelling,
  Kalman Filters (KFs) (Kalman et al., 1960) have been integrated with deep learning
  models, however, such approaches typically rely on approximate inference tech- niques
  such as variational inference which makes learning more complex and often less scalable
  due to approximation errors. We propose a new deep approach to Kalman filtering
  which can be learned directly in an end-to-end manner using backpropagation without
  additional approximations. Our approach uses a high-dimensional factorized latent
  state representation for which the Kalman updates simplify to scalar operations
  and thus avoids hard to backpropagate, computationally heavy and potentially unstable
  matrix inversions. Moreover, we use locally linear dynamic models to efficiently
  propagate the latent state to the next time step. The resulting network architecture,
  which we call Recurrent Kalman Network (RKN), can be used for any time-series data,
  similar to a LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) but uses an explicit representation
  of uncertainty. As shown by our experiments, the RKN obtains much more accurate
  uncertainty estimates than an LSTM or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al.,
  2014) while also showing a slightly improved prediction performance and outperforms
  various recent generative models on an image imputation task.
