abstract: 'Multi-task learning shares information between related tasks, sometimes
  reducing the number of parameters required. State-of-the-art results across multiple
  natural language understanding tasks in the GLUE benchmark have previously used
  transfer from a single large task: unsupervised pre-training with BERT, where a
  separate BERT model was fine-tuned for each task. We explore multi-task approaches
  that share a \hbox{single} BERT model with a small number of additional task-specific
  parameters. Using new adaptation modules, PALs or ‘projected attention layers’,
  we match the performance of separately fine-tuned models on the GLUE benchmark with
  $\approx$7 times fewer parameters, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the Recognizing
  Textual Entailment dataset.'
