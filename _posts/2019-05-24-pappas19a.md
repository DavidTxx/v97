abstract: Many tasks, including language generation, benefit from learning the structure
  of the output space, particularly when the space of output labels is large and the
  data is sparse. State-of-the-art neural language models indirectly capture the output
  space structure in their classifier weights since they lack parameter sharing across
  output labels. Learning shared output label mappings helps, but existing methods
  have limited expressivity and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we investigate
  the usefulness of more powerful shared mappings for output labels, and propose a
  deep residual output mapping with dropout between layers to better capture the structure
  of the output space and avoid overfitting. Evaluations on three language generation
  tasks show that our output label mapping can match or improve state-of-the-art recurrent
  and self-attention architectures, and suggest that the classifier does not necessarily
  need to be high-rank to better model natural language if it is better at capturing
  the structure of the output space.
