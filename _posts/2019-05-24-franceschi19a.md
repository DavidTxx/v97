abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular class of machine learning models
  that have been successfully applied to a range of problems. Their major advantage
  lies in their ability to explicitly incorporate a sparse and discrete dependency
  structure between data points. Unfortunately, GNNs can only be used when such a
  graph-structure is available. In practice, however, real-world graphs are often
  noisy and incomplete or might not be available at all. With this work, we propose
  to jointly learn the graph structure and the parameters of graph convolutional networks
  (GCNs) by approximately solving a bilevel program that learns a discrete probability
  distribution on the edges of the graph. This allows one to apply GCNs not only in
  scenarios where the given graph is incomplete or corrupted but also in those where
  a graph is not available. We conduct a series of experiments that analyze the behavior
  of the proposed method and demonstrate that it outperforms related methods by a
  significant margin.
