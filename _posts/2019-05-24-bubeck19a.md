abstract: Why are classifiers in high dimension vulnerable to “adversarial” perturbations?
  We show that it is likely not due to information theoretic limitations, but rather
  it could be due to computational constraints. First we prove that, for a broad set
  of classification tasks, the mere existence of a robust classifier implies that
  it can be found by a possibly exponential-time algorithm with relatively few training
  examples. Then we give two particular classification tasks where learning a robust
  classifier is computationally intractable. More precisely we construct two binary
  classifications task in high dimensional space which are (i) information theoretically
  easy to learn robustly for large perturbations, (ii) efficiently learnable (non-robustly)
  by a simple linear separator, (iii) yet are not efficiently robustly learnable,
  even for small perturbations. Specifically, for the first task hardness holds for
  any efficient algorithm in the statistical query (SQ) model, while for the second
  task we rule out any efficient algorithm under a cryptographic assumption. These
  examples give an exponential separation between classical learning and robust learning
  in the statistical query model or under a cryptographic assumption. It suggests
  that adversarial examples may be an unavoidable byproduct of computational limitations
  of learning algorithms.
