abstract: We propose algorithms for online principal component analysis (PCA) and
  variance minimization for adaptive settings. Previous literature has focused on
  upper bounding the static adversarial regret, whose comparator is the optimal fixed
  action in hindsight. However, static regret is not an appropriate metric when the
  underlying environment is changing. Instead, we adopt the adaptive regret metric
  from the previous literature and propose online adaptive algorithms for PCA and
  variance minimization, that have sub-linear adaptive regret guarantees. We demonstrate
  both theoretically and experimentally that the proposed algorithms can adapt to
  the changing environments.
