abstract: There has recently been a steady increase in the number iterative approaches
  to density estimation. However, an accompanying burst of formal convergence guarantees
  has not followed; all results pay the price of heavy assumptions which are often
  unrealistic or hard to check. The <em>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</em>
  literature — seemingly orthogonal to the aforementioned pursuit — has had the side
  effect of a renewed interest in variational divergence minimisation (notably $f$-GAN).
  We show how to combine this latter approach and the classical boosting theory in
  supervised learning to get the first density estimation algorithm that provably
  achieves geometric convergence under very weak assumptions. We do so by a trick
  allowing to combine <em>classifiers</em> as the sufficient statistics of an exponential
  family. Our analysis includes an improved variational characterisation of $f$-GAN.
