abstract: Despite remarkable successes, Deep Reinforce- ment Learning (DRL) is not
  robust to hyperparam- eterization, implementation details, or small envi- ronment
  changes (Henderson et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2018). Overcoming such sensitivity
  is key to making DRL applicable to real world problems. In this paper, we identify
  sensitivity to time dis- cretization in near continuous-time environments as a critical
  factor; this covers, e.g., changing the number of frames per second, or the action
  frequency of the controller. Empirically, we find that Q-learning-based approaches
  such as Deep Q- learning (Mnih et al., 2015) and Deep Determinis- tic Policy Gradient
  (Lillicrap et al., 2015) collapse with small time steps. Formally, we prove that
  Q-learning does not exist in continuous time. We detail a principled way to build
  an off-policy RL algorithm that yields similar performances over a wide range of
  time discretizations, and confirm this robustness empirically.
