abstract: 'In supervised learning, efficiency often starts with the choice of a good
  loss: support vector machines popularised Hinge loss, Adaboost popularised the exponential
  loss, etc. Recent trends in machine learning have highlighted the necessity for
  training routines to meet tight requirements on communication, bandwidth, energy,
  operations, encoding, among others. Fitting the often decades-old state of the art
  training routines into these new constraints does not go without pain and uncertainty
  or reduction in the original guarantees. Our paper starts with the design of a new
  strictly proper canonical, twice differentiable loss called the Q-loss. Importantly,
  its mirror update over (arbitrary) rational inputs uses only integer arithmetics
  â€“ more precisely, the sole use of $+, -, /, \times, |.|$. We build a learning algorithm
  which is able, under mild assumptions, to achieve a lossless boosting-compliant
  training. We give conditions for a quantization of its main memory footprint, weights,
  to be done while keeping the whole algorithm boosting-compliant. Experiments display
  that the algorithm can achieve a fast convergence during the early boosting rounds
  compared to AdaBoost, even with a weight storage that can be 30+ times smaller.
  Lastly, we show that the Bayes risk of the Q-loss can be used as node splitting
  criterion for decision trees and guarantees optimal boosting convergence.'
