abstract: 'Many recent successful (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms make use
  of regularization, generally based on entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence. We
  propose a general theory of regularized Markov Decision Processes that generalizes
  these approaches in two directions: we consider a larger class of regularizers,
  and we consider the general modified policy iteration approach, encompassing both
  policy iteration and value iteration. The core building blocks of this theory are
  a notion of regularized Bellman operator and the Legendre-Fenchel transform, a classical
  tool of convex optimization. This approach allows for error propagation analyses
  of general algorithmic schemes of which (possibly variants of) classical algorithms
  such as Trust Region Policy Optimization, Soft Q-learning, Stochastic Actor Critic
  or Dynamic Policy Programming are special cases. This also draws connections to
  proximal convex optimization, especially to Mirror Descent.'
