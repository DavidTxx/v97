abstract: Zero-sum games such as chess and poker are, abstractly, functions that evaluate
  pairs of agents, for example labeling them ‘winner’ and ‘loser’. If the game is
  approximately transitive, then self-play generates sequences of agents of increasing
  strength. However, nontransitive games, such as rock-paper-scissors, can exhibit
  strategic cycles, and there is no longer a clear objective – we want agents to increase
  in strength, but against whom is unclear. In this paper, we introduce a geometric
  framework for formulating agent objectives in zero-sum games, in order to construct
  adaptive sequences of objectives that yield open-ended learning. The framework allows
  us to reason about population performance in nontransitive games, and enables the
  development of a new algorithm (rectified Nash response, PSRO_rN) that uses game-theoretic
  niching to construct diverse populations of effective agents, producing a stronger
  set of agents than existing algorithms. We apply PSRO_rN to two highly nontransitive
  resource allocation games and find that PSRO_rN consistently outperforms the existing
  alternatives.
