abstract: Online advertising platforms are thriving due to the customizable audiences
  they offer advertisers. However, recent studies show that advertisements can be
  discriminatory with respect to the gender or race of the audience that sees the
  ad, and may inadvertently cross ethical and/or legal boundaries. To prevent this,
  we propose a constrained ad auction framework that maximizes the platform’s revenue
  conditioned on ensuring that the audience seeing an advertiser’s ad is distributed
  appropriately across sensitive types such as gender or race. Building upon Myerson’s
  classic work, we first present an optimal auction mechanism for a large class of
  fairness constraints. Finding the parameters of this optimal auction, however, turns
  out to be a non-convex problem. We show that this non-convex problem can be reformulated
  as a more structured non-convex problem with no saddle points or local-maxima; this
  allows us to develop a gradient-descent-based algorithm to solve it. Our empirical
  results on the A1 Yahoo! dataset demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain uniform
  coverage across different user types for each advertiser at a minor loss to the
  revenue of the platform, and a small change to the size of the audience each advertiser
  reaches.
