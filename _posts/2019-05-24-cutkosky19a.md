abstract: 'A standard way to obtain convergence guarantees in stochastic convex optimization
  is to run an online learning algorithm and then output the average of its iterates:
  the actual iterates of the online learning algorithm do not come with individual
  guarantees. We close this gap by introducing a black-box modification to any online
  learning algorithm whose iterates converge to the optimum in stochastic scenarios.
  We then consider the case of smooth losses, and show that combining our approach
  with optimistic online learning algorithms immediately yields a fast convergence
  rate of $O(L/T^{3/2}+\sigma/\sqrt{T})$ on $L$-smooth problems with $\sigma^2$ variance
  in the gradients. Finally, we provide a reduction that converts any adaptive online
  algorithm into one that obtains the optimal accelerated rate of $\tilde O(L/T^2
  + \sigma/\sqrt{T})$, while still maintaining $\tilde O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence
  in the non-smooth setting. Importantly, our algorithms adapt to $L$ and $\sigma$
  automatically: they do not need to know either to obtain these rates.'
