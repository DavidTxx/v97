abstract: We show that standard ResNet architectures can be made invertible, allowing
  the same model to be used for classification, density estimation, and generation.
  Typically, enforcing invertibility requires partitioning dimensions or restricting
  network architectures. In contrast, our approach only requires adding a simple normalization
  step during training, already available in standard frameworks. Invertible ResNets
  define a generative model which can be trained by maximum likelihood on unlabeled
  data. To compute likelihoods, we introduce a tractable approximation to the Jacobian
  log-determinant of a residual block. Our empirical evaluation shows that invertible
  ResNets perform competitively with both state-of-the-art image classifiers and flow-based
  generative models, something that has not been previously achieved with a single
  architecture.
