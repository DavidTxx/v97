abstract: To understand the dynamics of training in deep neural networks, we study
  the evolution of the Hessian eigenvalue density throughout the optimization process.
  In non-batch normalized networks, we observe the rapid appearance of large isolated
  eigenvalues in the spectrum, along with a surprising concentration of the gradient
  in the corresponding eigenspaces. In a batch normalized network, these two effects
  are almost absent. We give a theoretical rationale to partially explain these phenomena.
  As part of this work, we adapt advanced tools from numerical linear algebra that
  allow scalable and accurate estimation of the entire Hessian spectrum of ImageNet-scale
  neural networks; this technique may be of independent interest in other applications.
