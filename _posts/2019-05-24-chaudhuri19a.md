abstract: We consider the problem of identifying any k out of the best m arms in an
  n-armed stochastic multi-armed bandit; framed in the PAC setting, this particular
  problem generalises both the problem of “best subset selection” (Kalyanakrishnan
  & Stone, 2010) and that of selecting “one out of the best m” arms (Roy Chaudhuri
  & Kalyanakrishnan, 2017). We present a lower bound on the worst-case sample complexity
  for general k, and a fully sequential PAC algorithm, LUCB-k-m, which is more sample-efficient
  on easy instances. Also, extending our analysis to infinite-armed bandits, we present
  a PAC algorithm that is independent of n, which identifies an arm from the best
  $\rho$ fraction of arms using at most an additive poly-log number of samples than
  compared to the lower bound, thereby improving over Roy Chaudhuri & Kalyanakrishnan
  (2017) and Aziz et al. (2018). The problem of identifying k > 1 distinct arms from
  the best $\rho$ fraction is not always well-defined; for a special class of this
  problem, we present lower and upper bounds. Finally, through a reduction, we establish
  a relation between upper bounds for the “one out of the best $\rho$” problem for
  infinite instances and the “one out of the best m” problem for finite instances.
  We conjecture that it is more efficient to solve “small” finite instances using
  the latter formulation, rather than going through the former.
