abstract: Bayesian nonparametric models provide a principled way to automatically
  adapt the complexity of a model to the amount of the data available, but computation
  in such models is difficult. Amortized variational approximations are appealing
  because of their computational efficiency, but current methods rely on a fixed finite
  truncation of the infinite model. This truncation level can be difficult to set,
  and also interacts poorly with amortized methods due to the over-pruning problem.
  Instead, we propose a new variational approximation, based on a method from statistical
  physics called Russian roulette sampling. This allows the variational distribution
  to adapt its complexity during inference, without relying on a fixed truncation
  level, and while still obtaining an unbiased estimate of the gradient of the original
  variational objective. We demonstrate this method on infinite sized variational
  auto-encoders using a Beta-Bernoulli (Indian buffet process) prior.
