abstract: Autoencoders are a deep learning model for representation learning. When
  trained to minimize the distance between the data and its reconstruction, linear
  autoencoders (LAEs) learn the subspace spanned by the top principal directions but
  cannot learn the principal directions themselves. In this paper, we prove that $L_2$-regularized
  LAEs are symmetric at all critical points and learn the principal directions as
  the left singular vectors of the decoder. We smoothly parameterize the critical
  manifold and relate the minima to the MAP estimate of probabilistic PCA. We illustrate
  these results empirically and consider implications for PCA algorithms, computational
  neuroscience, and the algebraic topology of learning.
