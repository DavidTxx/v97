abstract: Ordinal Embedding is the problem of placing n objects into R^d to satisfy
  constraints like "object a is closer to b than to c." It can accommodate data that
  embeddings from features or distances cannot, but is a more difficult problem. We
  propose a novel landmark-based method as a partial solution. At small to medium
  scales, we present a novel combination of existing methods with some new theoretical
  justification. For very large values of n optimizing over an entire embedding breaks
  down, so we propose a novel method which first embeds a subset of m << n objects
  and then embeds the remaining objects independently and in parallel. We prove a
  distance error bound for our method in terms of m and that it has O(dn log m) time
  complexity, and show empirically that it is able to produce high quality embeddings
  in a fraction of the time needed for any published method.
