abstract: 'Submodular functions have found a wealth of new applications in data science
  and machine learning models in recent years. This has been coupled with many algorithmic
  advances in the area of submodular optimization: (SO) $\min/\max f(S): S \in \mathcal{F}$,
  where $\mathcal{F}$ is a given family of feasible sets over a ground set $V$ and
  $f:2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is submodular. In this work we focus on a more general
  class of <em>multivariate submodular optimization</em> (MVSO) problems: $\min/\max f
  (S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k): S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus S_k \in \mathcal{F}$.
  Here we use $\uplus$ to denote union of disjoint sets and hence this model is attractive
  where resources are being allocated across $k$ agents, who share a “joint” multivariate
  nonnegative objective $f(S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k)$ that captures some type of submodularity
  (i.e. diminishing returns) property. We provide some explicit examples and potential
  applications for this new framework. For maximization, we show that practical algorithms
  such as accelerated greedy variants and distributed algorithms achieve good approximation
  guarantees for very general families (such as matroids and $p$-systems). For arbitrary
  families, we show that monotone (resp. nonmonotone) MVSO admits an $\alpha (1-1/e)$
  (resp. $\alpha \cdot 0.385$) approximation whenever monotone (resp. nonmonotone)
  SO admits an $\alpha$-approximation over the multilinear formulation. This substantially
  expands the family of tractable models. On the minimization side we give essentially
  optimal approximations in terms of the curvature of $f$.'
