abstract: We consider the problem of learning representations that achieve group and
  subgroup fairness with respect to multiple sensitive attributes. Taking inspiration
  from the disentangled representation learning literature, we propose an algorithm
  for learning compact representations of datasets that are useful for reconstruction
  and prediction, but are also <em>flexibly fair</em>, meaning they can be easily
  modified at test time to achieve subgroup demographic parity with respect to multiple
  sensitive attributes and their conjunctions. We show empirically that the resulting
  encoder—which does not require the sensitive attributes for inference—allows for
  the adaptation of a single representation to a variety of fair classification tasks
  with new target labels and subgroup definitions.
