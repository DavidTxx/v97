abstract: We consider the scenario of online learning with sleeping experts, where
  not all experts are available at each round, and analyze the general framework of
  learning with feedback graphs, where the loss observations associated with each
  expert are characterized by a graph. A critical assumption in this framework is
  that the loss observations and the set of sleeping experts at each round are independent.
  We first extend the classical sleeping experts algorithm of Kleinberg et al. 2008
  to the feedback graphs scenario, and prove matching upper and lower bounds for the
  sleeping regret of the resulting algorithm under the independence assumption. Our
  main contribution is then to relax this assumption, present a more general notion
  of sleeping regret, and derive a general algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees.
  We apply this new framework to the important scenario of online learning with abstention,
  where a learner can elect to abstain from making a prediction at the price of a
  certain cost. We empirically validate our algorithm against multiple online abstention
  algorithms on several real-world datasets, showing substantial performance improvements.
