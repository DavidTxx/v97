abstract: 'We study the control of linear dynamical systems with adversarial disturbances,
  as opposed to statistical noise. We present an efficient algorithm that achieves
  nearly-tight regret bounds in this setting. Our result generalizes upon previous
  work in two main aspects: the algorithm can accommodate adversarial noise in the
  dynamics, and can handle general convex costs.'
