abstract: We present and study models of adversarial online learning where the feedback
  observed by the learner is noisy, and the feedback is either full information feedback
  or bandit feedback. Specifically, we consider binary losses xored with the noise,
  which is a Bernoulli random variable. We consider both a constant noise rate and
  a variable noise rate. Our main results are tight regret bounds for learning with
  noise in the adversarial online learning model.
