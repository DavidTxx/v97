abstract: 'Representations learnt through deep neural networks tend to be highly informative,
  but opaque in terms of what information they learn to encode. We introduce an approach
  to probabilistic modelling that learns to represent data with two separate deep
  representations: an invariant representation that encodes the information of the
  class from which the data belongs, and an equivariant representation that encodes
  the symmetry transformation defining the particular data point within the class
  manifold (equivariant in the sense that the representation varies naturally with
  symmetry transformations). This approach is based primarily on the strategic routing
  of data through the two latent variables, and thus is conceptually transparent,
  easy to implement, and in-principle generally applicable to any data comprised of
  discrete classes of continuous distributions (e.g. objects in images, topics in
  language, individuals in behavioural data). We demonstrate qualitatively compelling
  representation learning and competitive quantitative performance, in both supervised
  and semi-supervised settings, versus comparable modelling approaches in the literature
  with little fine tuning.'
