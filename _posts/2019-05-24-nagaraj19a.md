abstract: We study stochastic gradient descent <em>without replacement</em> (SGDo)
  for smooth convex functions. SGDo is widely observed to converge faster than true
  SGD where each sample is drawn independently <em>with replacement</em> (Bottou,2009)
  and hence, is more popular in practice. But itâ€™s convergence properties are not
  well understood as sampling without replacement leads to coupling between iterates
  and gradients. By using method of exchangeable pairs to bound Wasserstein distance,
  we provide the first non-asymptotic results for SGDo when applied to <em>general
  smooth, strongly-convex</em> functions. In particular, we show that SGDo converges
  at a rate of $O(1/K^2)$ while SGD is known to converge at $O(1/K)$ rate, where $K$
  denotes the number of passes over data and is required to be <em>large enough</em>.
  Existing results for SGDo in this setting require additional <em>Hessian Lipschitz
  assumption</em> (Gurbuzbalaban et al, 2015; HaoChen and Sra 2018). For <em>small</em>
  $K$, we show SGDo can achieve same convergence rate as SGD for <em>general smooth
  strongly-convex</em> functions. Existing results in this setting require $K=1$ and
  hold only for generalized linear models (Shamir,2016). In addition, by careful analysis
  of the coupling, for both large and small $K$, we obtain better dependence on problem
  dependent parameters like condition number.
