abstract: Model selection and evaluation are usually strictly separated by means of
  data splitting to enable an unbiased estimation and a simple statistical inference
  for the unknown generalization performance of the final prediction model. We investigate
  the properties of novel evaluation strategies, namely when the final model is selected
  based on empirical performances on the test data. To guard against selection induced
  overoptimism, we employ a parametric multiple test correction based on the approximate
  multivariate distribution of performance estimates. Our numerical experiments involve
  training common machine learning algorithms (EN, CART, SVM, XGB) on various artificial
  classification tasks. At its core, our proposed approach improves model selection
  in terms of the expected final model performance without introducing overoptimism.
  We furthermore observed a higher probability for a successful evaluation study,
  making it easier in practice to empirically demonstrate a sufficiently high predictive
  performance.
