abstract: In this paper, we propose the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network
  (SAGAN) which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for image
  generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details
  as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In
  SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover,
  the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of
  the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that
  generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply
  spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training
  dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than prior work, boosting the best
  published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Fr√©chet Inception distance
  from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention
  layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object
  shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.
