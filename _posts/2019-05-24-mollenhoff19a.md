abstract: We take the novel perspective to view data not as a probability distribution
  but rather as a current. Primarily studied in the field of geometric measure theory,
  k-currents are continuous linear functionals acting on compactly supported smooth
  differential forms and can be understood as a generalized notion of oriented k-dimensional
  manifold. By moving from distributions (which are 0-currents) to k-currents, we
  can explicitly orient the data by attaching a k-dimensional tangent plane to each
  sample point. Based on the flat metric which is a fundamental distance between currents,
  we derive FlatGAN, a formulation in the spirit of generative adversarial networks
  but generalized to k-currents. In our theoretical contribution we prove that the
  flat metric between a parametrized current and a reference current is Lipschitz
  continuous in the parameters. In experiments, we show that the proposed shift to
  k>0 leads to interpretable and disentangled latent representations which behave
  equivariantly to the specified oriented tangent planes.
