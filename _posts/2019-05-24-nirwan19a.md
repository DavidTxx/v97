abstract: We consider probabilistic PCA and related factor models from a Bayesian
  perspective. These models are in general not identifiable as the likelihood has
  a rotational symmetry. This gives rise to complicated posterior distributions with
  continuous subspaces of equal density and thus hinders efficiency of inference as
  well as interpretation of obtained parameters. In particular, posterior averages
  over factor loadings become meaningless and only model predictions are unambiguous.
  Here, we propose a parameterization based on Householder transformations, which
  remove the rotational symmetry of the posterior. Furthermore, by relying on results
  from random matrix theory, we establish the parameter distribution which leaves
  the model unchanged compared to the original rotationally symmetric formulation.
  In particular, we avoid the need to compute the Jacobian determinant of the parameter
  transformation. This allows us to efficiently implement probabilistic PCA in a rotation
  invariant fashion in any state of the art toolbox. Here, we implemented our model
  in the probabilistic programming language Stan and illustrate it on several examples.
