abstract: We present a blended conditional gradient approach for minimizing a smooth
  convex function over a polytope P, combining the Frank{–}Wolfe algorithm (also called
  conditional gradient) with gradient-based steps, different from away steps and pairwise
  steps, but still achieving linear convergence for strongly convex functions, along
  with good practical performance. Our approach retains all favorable properties of
  conditional gradient algorithms, notably avoidance of projections onto P and maintenance
  of iterates as sparse convex combinations of a limited number of extreme points
  of P. The algorithm is lazy, making use of inexpensive inexact solutions of the
  linear programming subproblem that characterizes the conditional gradient approach.
  It decreases measures of optimality (primal and dual gaps) rapidly, both in the
  number of iterations and in wall-clock time, outperforming even the lazy conditional
  gradient algorithms of Braun et al. 2017. We also present a streamlined version
  of the algorithm that applies when P is the probability simplex.
