abstract: We introduce an approach to learn representations based on the Lorentzian
  distance in hyperbolic geometry. Hyperbolic geometry is especially suited to hierarchically-structured
  datasets, which are prevalent in the real world. Current hyperbolic representation
  learning methods compare examples with the Poincar√© distance. They try to minimize
  the distance of each node in a hierarchy with its descendants while maximizing its
  distance with other nodes. This formulation produces node representations close
  to the centroid of their descendants. To obtain efficient and interpretable algorithms,
  we exploit the fact that the centroid w.r.t the squared Lorentzian distance can
  be written in closed-form. We show that the Euclidean norm of such a centroid decreases
  as the curvature of the hyperbolic space decreases. This property makes it appropriate
  to represent hierarchies where parent nodes minimize the distances to their descendants
  and have smaller Euclidean norm than their children. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art
  results in retrieval and classification tasks on different datasets.
