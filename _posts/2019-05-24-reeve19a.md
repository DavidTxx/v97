abstract: We consider classification in the presence of class-dependent asymmetric
  label noise with unknown noise probabilities. In this setting, identifiability conditions
  are known, but additional assumptions were shown to be required for finite sample
  rates, and so far only the parametric rate has been obtained. Assuming these identifiability
  conditions, together with a measure-smoothness condition on the regression function
  and Tsybakovâ€™s margin condition, we show that the Robust kNN classifier of Gao et
  al. attains, the mini-max optimal rates of the noise-free setting, up to a log factor,
  even when trained on data with unknown asymmetric label noise. Hence, our results
  provide a solid theoretical backing for this empirically successful algorithm. By
  contrast the standard kNN is not even consistent in the setting of asymmetric label
  noise. A key idea in our analysis is a simple kNN based method for estimating the
  maximum of a function that requires far less assumptions than existing mode estimators
  do, and which may be of independent interest for noise proportion estimation and
  randomised optimisation problems.
