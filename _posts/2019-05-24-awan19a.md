abstract: The exponential mechanism is a fundamental tool of Differential Privacy
  (DP) due to its strong privacy guarantees and flexibility. We study its extension
  to settings with summaries based on infinite dimensional outputs such as with functional
  data analysis, shape analysis, and nonparametric statistics. We show that the mechanism
  must be designed with respect to a specific base measure over the output space,
  such as a Gaussian process. We provide a positive result that establishes a Central
  Limit Theorem for the exponential mechanism quite broadly. We also provide a negative
  result, showing that the magnitude of noise introduced for privacy is asymptotically
  non-negligible relative to the statistical estimation error. We develop an $\ep$-DP
  mechanism for functional principal component analysis, applicable in separable Hilbert
  spaces, and demonstrate its performance via simulations and applications to two
  datasets.
