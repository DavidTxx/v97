abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of deep generative models
  which aim to learn a target distribution in an unsupervised fashion. While they
  were successfully applied to many problems, training a GAN is a notoriously challenging
  task and requires a significant number of hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture
  engineering, and a non-trivial amount of “tricks". The success in many practical
  applications coupled with the lack of a measure to quantify the failure modes of
  GANs resulted in a plethora of proposed losses, regularization and normalization
  schemes, as well as neural architectures. In this work we take a sober view of the
  current state of GANs from a practical perspective. We discuss and evaluate common
  pitfalls and reproducibility issues, open-source our code on Github, and provide
  pre-trained models on TensorFlow Hub.
