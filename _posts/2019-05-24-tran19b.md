abstract: The olfactory system employs an ensemble of odorant receptors (ORs) to sense
  odorants and to derive olfactory percepts. We trained artificial neural networks
  to represent the chemical space of odorants and used this representation to predict
  human olfactory percepts. We hypothesized that ORs may be considered 3D convolutional
  filters that extract molecular features and, as such, can be trained using machine
  learning methods. First, we trained a convolutional autoencoder, called DeepNose,
  to deduce a low-dimensional representation of odorant molecules which were represented
  by their 3D spatial structure. Next, we tested the ability of DeepNose features
  in predicting physical properties and odorant percepts based on 3D molecular structure
  alone. We found that, despite the lack of human expertise, DeepNose features often
  outperformed molecular descriptors used in computational chemistry in predicting
  both physical properties and human perceptions. We propose that DeepNose network
  can extract <em>de novo</em> chemical features predictive of various bioactivities
  and can help understand the factors influencing the composition of ORs ensemble.
