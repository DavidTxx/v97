abstract: We present a dynamical system framework for understanding Nesterovâ€™s accelerated
  gradient method. In contrast to earlier work, our derivation does not rely on a
  vanishing step size argument. We show that Nesterov acceleration arises from discretizing
  an ordinary differential equation with a semi-implicit Euler integration scheme.
  We analyze both the underlying differential equation as well as the discretization
  to obtain insights into the phenomenon of acceleration. The analysis suggests that
  a curvature-dependent damping term lies at the heart of the phenomenon. We further
  establish connections between the discretized and the continuous-time dynamics.
