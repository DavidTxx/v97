abstract: In this paper we study the problem of robust influence maximization in the
  independent cascade model under a hyperparametric assumption. In social networks
  users influence and are influenced by individuals with similar characteristics and
  as such they are associated with some features. A recent surging research direction
  in influence maximization focuses on the case where the edge probabilities on the
  graph are not arbitrary but are generated as a function of the features of the users
  and a global hyperparameter. We propose a model where the objective is to maximize
  the worst-case number of influenced users for any possible value of that hyperparameter.
  We provide theoretical results showing that proper robust solution in our model
  is NP-hard and an algorithm that achieves improper robust optimization. We make-use
  of sampling based techniques and of the renowned multiplicative weight updates algorithm.
  Additionally we validate our method empirically and prove that it outperforms the
  state-of-the-art robust influence maximization techniques.
