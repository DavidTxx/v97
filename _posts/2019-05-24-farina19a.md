abstract: The CFR framework has been a powerful tool for solving large-scale extensive-form
  games in practice. However, the theoretical rate at which past CFR-based algorithms
  converge to the Nash equilibrium is on the order of $O(T^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is
  the number of iterations. In contrast, first-order methods can be used to achieve
  a $O(T^{-1})$ dependence on iterations, yet these methods have been less successful
  in practice. In this work we present the first CFR variant that breaks the square-root
  dependence on iterations. By combining and extending recent advances on predictive
  and stable regret minimizers for the matrix-game setting we show that it is possible
  to leverage “optimistic” regret minimizers to achieve a $O(T^{-3/4})$ convergence
  rate within CFR. This is achieved by introducing a new notion of stable-predictivity,
  and by setting the stability of each counterfactual regret minimizer relative to
  its location in the decision tree. Experiments show that this method is faster than
  the original CFR algorithm, although not as fast as newer variants, in spite of
  their worst-case $O(T^{-1/2})$ dependence on iterations.
