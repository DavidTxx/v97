abstract: Off-policy evaluation is the problem of estimating the value of a target
  policy using data collected under a different policy. Given a base estimator for
  bandit off-policy evaluation and a parametrized class of control variates, we address
  the problem of computing a control variate in that class that reduces the risk of
  the base estimator. We derive the population risk as a function of the class parameters
  and we establish conditions that guarantee risk improvement. We present our main
  results in the context of multi-armed bandits, and we propose a simple design for
  contextual bandits that gives rise to an estimator that is shown to perform well
  in multi-class cost-sensitive classification datasets.
