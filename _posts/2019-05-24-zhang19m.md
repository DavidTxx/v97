abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a data efficient
  approach for learning control tasks but is difficult to utilize in domains with
  complex observations such as images. In this paper, we present a method for learning
  representations that are suitable for iterative model-based policy improvement,
  even when the underlying dynamical system has complex dynamics and image observations,
  in that these representations are optimized for inferring simple dynamics and cost
  models given data from the current policy. This enables a model-based RL method
  based on the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) to be used for systems with image
  observations. We evaluate our approach on a range of robotics tasks, including manipulation
  with a real-world robotic arm directly from images. We find that our method produces
  substantially better final performance than other model-based RL methods while being
  significantly more efficient than model-free RL.
