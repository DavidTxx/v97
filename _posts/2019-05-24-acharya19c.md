abstract: We consider the problems of distribution estimation, and heavy hitter (frequency)
  estimation under privacy, and communication constraints. While the constraints have
  been studied separately, optimal schemes for one are sub-optimal for the other.
  We propose a sample-optimal $\eps$-locally differentially private (LDP) scheme for
  distribution estimation, where each user communicates one bit, and requires <em>no</em>
  public randomness. We also show that Hadamard Response, a recently proposed scheme
  for $\eps$-LDP distribution estimation is also utility-optimal for heavy hitters
  estimation. Our final result shows that unlike distribution estimation, without
  public randomness, any utility-optimal heavy hitter estimation algorithm must require
  $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of communication per user.
