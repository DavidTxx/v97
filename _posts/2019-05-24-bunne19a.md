abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks have shown remarkable success in learning
  a distribution that faithfully recovers a reference distribution in its entirety.
  However, in some cases, we may want to only learn some aspects (e.g., cluster or
  manifold structure), while modifying others (e.g., style, orientation or dimension).
  In this work, we propose an approach to learn generative models across such incomparable
  spaces, and demonstrate how to steer the learned distribution towards target properties.
  A key component of our model is the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, a notion of discrepancy
  that compares distributions relationally rather than absolutely. While this framework
  subsumes current generative models in identically reproducing distributions, its
  inherent flexibility allows application to tasks in manifold learning, relational
  learning and cross-domain learning.
