abstract: Naive mean field variational methods are the state of-the-art approach to
  inference in topic modeling. We show that these methods suffer from an instability
  that can produce misleading conclusions. Namely, for certain regimes of the model
  parameters, variational inference outputs a non-trivial decomposition into topics.
  However -for the same parameter values- the data contain no actual information about
  the true topic decomposition, and the output of the algorithm is uncorrelated with
  it. In particular, the estimated posterior mean is wrong, and estimated credible
  regions do not achieve the nominal coverage. We discuss how this instability is
  remedied by more accurate mean field approximations.
