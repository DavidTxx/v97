abstract: 'It is generally believed that submodular functions–and the more general
  class of $\gamma$-weakly submodular functions–may only be optimized under the non-negativity
  assumption $f(S) \geq 0$. In this paper, we show that once the function is expressed
  as the difference $f = g - c$, where $g$ is monotone, non-negative, and $\gamma$-weakly
  submodular and $c$ is non-negative modular, then strong approximation guarantees
  may be obtained. We present an algorithm for maximizing $g - c$ under a $k$-cardinality
  constraint which produces a random feasible set $S$ such that $\mathbb{E}[g(S) -c(S)]
  \geq (1 - e^{-\gamma} - \epsilon) g(\opt) - c(\opt)$, whose running time is $O (\frac{n}{\epsilon}
  \log^2 \frac{1}{\epsilon})$, independent of $k$. We extend these results to the
  unconstrained setting by describing an algorithm with the same approximation guarantees
  and faster $O(n \frac{1}{\epsilon} \log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ runtime. The main techniques
  underlying our algorithms are two-fold: the use of a surrogate objective which varies
  the relative importance between $g$ and $c$ throughout the algorithm, and a geometric
  sweep over possible $\gamma$ values. Our algorithmic guarantees are complemented
  by a hardness result showing that no polynomial-time algorithm which accesses $g$
  through a value oracle can do better. We empirically demonstrate the success of
  our algorithms by applying them to experimental design on the Boston Housing dataset
  and directed vertex cover on the Email EU dataset.'
