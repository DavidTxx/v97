abstract: We present an environment, benchmark, and deep learning driven automated
  theorem prover for higher-order logic. Higher-order interactive theorem provers
  enable the formalization of arbitrary mathematical theories and thereby present
  an interesting challenge for deep learning. We provide an open-source framework
  based on the HOL Light theorem prover that can be used as a reinforcement learning
  environment. HOL Light comes with a broad coverage of basic mathematical theorems
  on calculus and the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture, from which we derive
  a challenging benchmark for automated reasoning approaches. We also present a deep
  reinforcement learning driven automated theorem prover, DeepHOL, that gives strong
  initial results on this benchmark.
