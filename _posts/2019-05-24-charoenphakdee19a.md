abstract: This paper aims to provide a better understanding of a symmetric loss. First,
  we emphasize that using a symmetric loss is advantageous in the balanced error rate
  (BER) minimization and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
  maximization from corrupted labels. Second, we prove general theoretical properties
  of symmetric losses, including a classification-calibration condition, excess risk
  bound, conditional risk minimizer, and AUC-consistency condition. Third, since all
  nonnegative symmetric losses are non-convex, we propose a convex barrier hinge loss
  that benefits significantly from the symmetric condition, although it is not symmetric
  everywhere. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the relevance of the symmetric
  condition.
