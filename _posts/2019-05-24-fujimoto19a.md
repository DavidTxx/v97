abstract: Many practical applications of reinforcement learning constrain agents to
  learn from a fixed batch of data which has already been gathered, without offering
  further possibility for data collection. In this paper, we demonstrate that due
  to errors introduced by extrapolation, standard off-policy deep reinforcement learning
  algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, are incapable of learning with data uncorrelated
  to the distribution under the current policy, making them ineffective for this fixed
  batch setting. We introduce a novel class of off-policy algorithms, batch-constrained
  reinforcement learning, which restricts the action space in order to force the agent
  towards behaving close to on-policy with respect to a subset of the given data.
  We present the first continuous control deep reinforcement learning algorithm which
  can learn effectively from arbitrary, fixed batch data, and empirically demonstrate
  the quality of its behavior in several tasks.
