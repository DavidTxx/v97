abstract: 'The convolutional layers are core building blocks of neural network architectures.
  In general, a convolutional filter applies to the entire frequency spectrum of the
  input data. We explore artificially constraining the frequency spectra of these
  filters and data, called band-limiting, during training. The frequency domain constraints
  apply to both the feed-forward and back-propagation steps. Experimentally, we observe
  that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are resilient to this compression scheme
  and results suggest that CNNs learn to leverage lower-frequency components. In particular,
  we found: (1) band-limited training can effectively control the resource usage (GPU
  and memory); (2) models trained with band-limited layers retain high prediction
  accuracy; and (3) requires no modification to existing training algorithms or neural
  network architectures to use unlike other compression schemes.'
