abstract: Deep neural networks excel at learning the training data, but often provide
  incorrect and confident predictions when evaluated on slightly different test examples.
  This includes distribution shifts, outliers, and adversarial examples. To address
  these issues, we propose \manifoldmixup{}, a simple regularizer that encourages
  neural networks to predict less confidently on interpolations of hidden representations.
  \manifoldmixup{} leverages semantic interpolations as additional training signal,
  obtaining neural networks with smoother decision boundaries at multiple levels of
  representation. As a result, neural networks trained with \manifoldmixup{} learn
  flatter class-representations, that is, with fewer directions of variance. We prove
  theory on why this flattening happens under ideal conditions, validate it empirically
  on practical situations, and connect it to the previous works on information theory
  and generalization. In spite of incurring no significant computation and being implemented
  in a few lines of code, \manifoldmixup{} improves strong baselines in supervised
  learning, robustness to single-step adversarial attacks, and test log-likelihood.
