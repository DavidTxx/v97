abstract: A typical audio signal processing pipeline includes multiple disjoint analysis
  stages, including calculation of a time-frequency representation followed by spectrogram-based
  feature analysis. We show how time-frequency analysis and nonnegative matrix factorisation
  can be jointly formulated as a spectral mixture Gaussian process model with nonstationary
  priors over the amplitude variance parameters. Further, we formulate this nonlinear
  modelâ€™s state space representation, making it amenable to infinite-horizon Gaussian
  process regression with approximate inference via expectation propagation, which
  scales linearly in the number of time steps and quadratically in the state dimensionality.
  By doing so, we are able to process audio signals with hundreds of thousands of
  data points. We demonstrate, on various tasks with empirical data, how this inference
  scheme outperforms more standard techniques that rely on extended Kalman filtering.
