abstract: Smooth finite-sum optimization has been widely studied in both convex and
  nonconvex settings. However, existing lower bounds for finite-sum optimization are
  mostly limited to the setting where each component function is (strongly) convex,
  while the lower bounds for nonconvex finite-sum optimization remain largely unsolved.
  In this paper, we study the lower bounds for smooth nonconvex finite-sum optimization,
  where the objective function is the average of $n$ nonconvex component functions.
  We prove tight lower bounds for the complexity of finding $\epsilon$-suboptimal
  point and $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point in different settings, for a wide
  regime of the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian of the objective function (or each
  component function). Given our lower bounds, we can show that existing algorithms
  including {KatyushaX} \citep{allen2018katyushax}, {Natasha} \citep{allen2017natasha}
  and {StagewiseKatyusha} \citep{yang2018does} have achieved optimal {Incremental
  First-order Oracle} (IFO) complexity (i.e., number of IFO calls) up to logarithm
  factors for nonconvex finite-sum optimization. We also point out potential ways
  to further improve these complexity results, in terms of making stronger assumptions
  or by a different convergence analysis.
