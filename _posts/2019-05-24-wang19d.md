abstract: We consider the problem of imitation learning from a finite set of expert
  trajectories, without access to reinforcement signals. The classical approach of
  extracting the expertâ€™s reward function via inverse reinforcement learning, followed
  by reinforcement learning is indirect and may be computationally expensive. Recent
  generative adversarial methods based on matching the policy distribution between
  the expert and the agent could be unstable during training. We propose a new framework
  for imitation learning by estimating the support of the expert policy to compute
  a fixed reward function, which allows us to re-frame imitation learning within the
  standard reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate the efficacy of our reward
  function on both discrete and continuous domains, achieving comparable or better
  performance than the state of the art under different reinforcement learning algorithms.
