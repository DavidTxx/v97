abstract: Building on the success of deep learning, two modern approaches to learn
  a probability model from the data are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
  Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). VAEs consider an explicit probability model for
  the data and compute a generative distribution by maximizing a variational lower-bound
  on the log-likelihood function. GANs, however, compute a generative model by minimizing
  a distance between observed and generated probability distributions without considering
  an explicit model for the observed data. The lack of having explicit probability
  models in GANs prohibits computation of sample likelihoods in their frameworks and
  limits their use in statistical inference problems. In this work, we resolve this
  issue by constructing an explicit probability model that can be used to compute
  sample likelihood statistics in GANs. In particular, we prove that under this probability
  model, a family of Wasserstein GANs with an entropy regularization can be viewed
  as a generative model that maximizes a variational lower-bound on average sample
  log likelihoods, an approach that VAEs are based on. This result makes a principled
  connection between two modern generative models, namely GANs and VAEs. In addition
  to the aforementioned theoretical results, we compute likelihood statistics for
  GANs trained on Gaussian, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and LSUN datasets. Our numerical
  results validate the proposed theory.
