abstract: The Exploration-Exploitation tradeoff arises in Reinforcement Learning when
  one cannot tell if a policy is optimal. Then, there is a constant need to explore
  new actions instead of exploiting past experience. In practice, it is common to
  resolve the tradeoff by using a fixed exploration mechanism, such as $\epsilon$-greedy
  exploration or by adding Gaussian noise, while still trying to learn an optimal
  policy. In this work, we take a different approach and study exploration-conscious
  criteria, that result in optimal policies with respect to the exploration mechanism.
  Solving these criteria, as we establish, amounts to solving a surrogate Markov Decision
  Process. We continue and analyze properties of exploration-conscious optimal policies
  and characterize two general approaches to solve such criteria. Building on the
  approaches, we apply simple changes in existing tabular and deep Reinforcement Learning
  algorithms and empirically demonstrate superior performance relatively to their
  non-exploration-conscious counterparts, both for discrete and continuous action
  spaces.
