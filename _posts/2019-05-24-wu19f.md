abstract: Domain adaptation addresses the common situation in which the target distribution
  generating our test data differs from the source distribution generating our training
  data. While absent assumptions, domain adaptation is impossible, strict conditions,
  e.g. covariate or label shift, enable principled algorithms. Recently-proposed domain-adversarial
  approaches consist of aligning source and target encodings, an approach often motivated
  as minimizing two (of three) terms in a theoretical bound on target error. Unfortunately,
  this minimization can cause arbitrary increases in the third term, a problem guaranteed
  to arise under shifting label distributions. We propose asymmetrically-relaxed distribution
  alignment, a new approach that overcomes some limitations of standard domain-adversarial
  algorithms. Moreover, we characterize precise assumptions under which our algorithm
  is theoretically principled and demonstrate empirical benefits on both synthetic
  and real datasets.
