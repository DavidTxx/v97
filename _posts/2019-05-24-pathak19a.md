abstract: Efficient exploration is a long-standing problem in sensorimotor learning.
  Major advances have been demonstrated in noise-free, non-stochastic domains such
  as video games and simulation. However, most of these formulations either get stuck
  in environments with stochastic dynamics or are too inefficient to be scalable to
  real robotics setups. In this paper, we propose a formulation for exploration inspired
  by the work in active learning literature. Specifically, we train an ensemble of
  dynamics models and incentivize the agent to explore such that the disagreement
  of those ensembles is maximized. This allows the agent to learn skills by exploring
  in a self-supervised manner without any external reward. Notably, we further leverage
  the disagreement objective to optimize the agentâ€™s policy in a differentiable manner,
  without using reinforcement learning, which results in a sample-efficient exploration.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of this formulation across a variety of benchmark environments
  including stochastic-Atari, Mujoco and Unity. Finally, we implement our differentiable
  exploration on a real robot which learns to interact with objects completely from
  scratch. Project videos and code are at https://pathak22.github.io/exploration-by-disagreement/
