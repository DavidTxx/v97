abstract: This paper shows that every sublevel set of the loss function of a class
  of deep over-parameterized neural nets with piecewise linear activation functions
  is connected and unbounded. This implies that the loss has no bad local valleys
  and all of its global minima are connected within a unique and potentially very
  large global valley.
