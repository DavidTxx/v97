abstract: Dropout regularization of deep neural networks has been a mysterious yet
  effective tool to prevent overfitting. Explanations for its success range from the
  prevention of "co-adapted" weights to it being a form of cheap Bayesian inference.
  We propose a novel framework for understanding multiplicative noise in neural networks,
  considering continuous distributions as well as Bernoulli noise (i.e. dropout).
  We show that multiplicative noise induces structured shrinkage priors on a network’s
  weights. We derive the equivalence through reparametrization properties of scale
  mixtures and without invoking any approximations. Given the equivalence, we then
  show that dropout’s Monte Carlo training objective approximates marginal MAP estimation.
  We leverage these insights to propose a novel shrinkage framework for resnets, terming
  the prior ’automatic depth determination’ as it is the natural analog of automatic
  relevance determination for network depth. Lastly, we investigate two inference
  strategies that improve upon the aforementioned MAP approximation in regression
  benchmarks.
