abstract: 'It is not easy to design and run Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due
  to: 1) finding the optimal number of filters (i.e., the width) at each layer is
  tricky, given an architecture; and 2) the computational intensity of CNNs impedes
  the deployment on computationally limited devices. Oracle Pruning is designed to
  remove the unimportant filters from a well-trained CNN, which estimates the filtersâ€™
  importance by ablating them in turn and evaluating the model, thus delivers high
  accuracy but suffers from intolerable time complexity, and requires a given resulting
  width but cannot automatically find it. To address these problems, we propose Approximated
  Oracle Filter Pruning (AOFP), which keeps searching for the least important filters
  in a binary search manner, makes pruning attempts by masking out filters randomly,
  accumulates the resulting errors, and finetunes the model via a multi-path framework.
  As AOFP enables simultaneous pruning on multiple layers, we can prune an existing
  very deep CNN with acceptable time cost, negligible accuracy drop, and no heuristic
  knowledge, or re-design a model which exerts higher accuracy and faster inference.'
