abstract: Bayesian inference via standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
  such as Metropolis-Hastings is too computationally intensive to handle large datasets,
  since the cost per step usually scales like $O(n)$ in the number of data points
  $n$. We propose the Scalable Metropolis-Hastings (SMH) kernel that only requires
  processing on average $O(1)$ or even $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ data points per step. This
  scheme is based on a combination of factorized acceptance probabilities, procedures
  for fast simulation of Bernoulli processes, and control variate ideas. Contrary
  to many MCMC subsampling schemes such as fixed step-size Stochastic Gradient Langevin
  Dynamics, our approach is exact insofar as the invariant distribution is the true
  posterior and not an approximation to it. We characterise the performance of our
  algorithm theoretically, and give realistic and verifiable conditions under which
  it is geometrically ergodic. This theory is borne out by empirical results that
  demonstrate overall performance benefits over standard Metropolis-Hastings and various
  subsampling algorithms.
