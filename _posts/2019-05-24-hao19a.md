abstract: 'Distribution estimation is a statistical-learning cornerstone. Its classical
  <em>min-max</em> formulation minimizes the estimation error for the worst distribution,
  hence under-performs for practical distributions that, like power-law, are often
  rather simple. Modern research has therefore focused on two frameworks: <em>structural</em>
  estimation that improves learning accuracy by assuming a simple structure of the
  underlying distribution; and <em>competitive</em>, or <em>instance-optimal</em>,
  estimation that achieves the performance of a genie aided estimator up to a small
  excess error that vanishes as the sample size grows, regardless of the distribution.
  This paper combines and strengthens the two frameworks. It designs a single estimator
  whose excess error vanishes both at a universal rate as the sample size grows, as
  well as when the (unknown) distribution gets simpler. We show that the resulting
  algorithm significantly improves the performance guarantees for numerous competitive-
  and structural-estimation results. The algorithm runs in near-linear time and is
  robust to model misspecification and domain-symbol permutations.'
