abstract: Mean field inference for discrete graphical models is generally a highly
  nonconvex problem, which also holds for the class of probabilistic log-submodular
  models. Existing optimization methods, e.g., coordinate ascent algorithms, typically
  only find local optima. In this work we propose provable mean filed methods for
  probabilistic log-submodular models and its posterior agreement (PA) with strong
  approximation guarantees. The main algorithmic technique is a new Double Greedy
  scheme, termed DR-DoubleGreedy, for continuous DR-submodular maximization with box-constraints.
  It is a one-pass algorithm with linear time complexity, reaching the optimal 1/2
  approximation ratio, which may be of independent interest. We validate the superior
  performance of our algorithms against baselines on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
