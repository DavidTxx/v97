abstract: Machine learning promises methods that generalize well from finite labeled
  data. However, the brittleness of existing neural net approaches is revealed by
  notable failures, such as the existence of adversarial examples that are misclassified
  despite being nearly identical to a training example, or the inability of recurrent
  sequence-processing nets to stay on track without teacher forcing. We introduce
  a method, which we refer to as _state reification_, that involves modeling the distribution
  of hidden states over the training data and then projecting hidden states observed
  during testing toward this distribution. Our intuition is that if the network can
  remain in a familiar manifold of hidden space, subsequent layers of the net should
  be well trained to respond appropriately. We show that this state-reification method
  helps neural nets to generalize better, especially when labeled data are sparse,
  and also helps overcome the challenge of achieving robust generalization with adversarial
  training.
