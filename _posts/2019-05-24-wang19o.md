abstract: Understanding generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) is a significant
  challenge, as many common assumptions of traditional supervised learning theory
  do not apply. We focus on the special class of reparameterizable RL problems, where
  the trajectory distribution can be decomposed using the reparametrization trick.
  For this problem class, estimating the expected return is efficient and the trajectory
  can be computed deterministically given peripheral random variables, which enables
  us to study reparametrizable RL using supervised learning and transfer learning
  theory. Through these relationships, we derive guarantees on the gap between the
  expected and empirical return for both intrinsic and external errors, based on Rademacher
  complexity as well as the PAC-Bayes bound. Our bound suggests the generalization
  capability of reparameterizable RL is related to multiple factors including “smoothness”
  of the environment transition, reward and agent policy function class. We also empirically
  verify the relationship between the generalization gap and these factors through
  simulations.
