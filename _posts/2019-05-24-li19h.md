abstract: In this article, we propose a new class of priors for Bayesian inference
  with multiple Gaussian graphical models. We introduce Bayesian treatments of two
  popular procedures, the group graphical lasso and the fused graphical lasso, and
  extend them to a continuous spike-and-slab framework to allow self-adaptive shrinkage
  and model selection simultaneously. We develop an EM algorithm that performs fast
  and dynamic explorations of posterior modes. Our approach selects sparse models
  efficiently and automatically with substantially smaller bias than would be induced
  by alternative regularization procedures. The performance of the proposed methods
  are demonstrated through simulation and two real data examples.
