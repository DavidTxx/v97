abstract: 'Importance-weighted risk minimization is a key ingredient in many machine
  learning algorithms for causal inference, domain adaptation, class imbalance, and
  off-policy reinforcement learning. While the effect of importance weighting is well-characterized
  for low-capacity misspecified models, little is known about how it impacts over-parameterized,
  deep neural networks. This work is inspired by recent theoretical results showing
  that on (linearly) separable data, deep linear networks optimized by SGD learn weight-agnostic
  solutions, prompting us to ask, for realistic deep networks, for which many practical
  datasets are separable, what is the effect of importance weighting? We present the
  surprising finding that while importance weighting impacts models early in training,
  its effect diminishes over successive epochs. Moreover, while L2 regularization
  and batch normalization (but not dropout), restore some of the impact of importance
  weighting, they express the effect via (seemingly) the wrong abstraction: why should
  practitioners tweak the L2 regularization, and by how much, to produce the correct
  weighting effect? Our experiments confirm these findings across a range of architectures
  and datasets.'
