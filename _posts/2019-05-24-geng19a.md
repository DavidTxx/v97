abstract: We propose a partially linear additive Gaussian graphical model (PLA-GGM)
  for the estimation of associations between random variables distorted by observed
  confounders. Model parameters are estimated using an $L_1$-regularized maximal pseudo-profile
  likelihood estimator (MaPPLE) for which we prove a $\sqrt{n}$-sparsistency. Importantly,
  our approach avoids parametric constraints on the effects of confounders on the
  estimated graphical model structure. Empirically, the PLA-GGM is applied to both
  synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to
  competing methods.
