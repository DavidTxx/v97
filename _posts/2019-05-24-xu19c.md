abstract: Difference of convex (DC) functions cover a broad family of non-convex and
  possibly non-smooth and non-differentiable functions, and have wide applications
  in machine learning and statistics. Although deterministic algorithms for DC functions
  have been extensively studied, stochastic optimization that is more suitable for
  learning with big data remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose new stochastic
  optimization algorithms and study their first-order convergence theories for solving
  a broad family of DC functions. We improve the existing algorithms and theories
  of stochastic optimization for DC functions from both practical and theoretical
  perspectives. Moreover, we extend the proposed stochastic algorithms for DC functions
  to solve problems with a general non-convex non-differentiable regularizer, which
  does not necessarily have a DC decomposition but enjoys an efficient proximal mapping.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that gives the first non-asymptotic
  convergence for solving non-convex optimization whose objective has a general non-convex
  non-differentiable regularizer.
