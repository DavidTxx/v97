abstract: Learning a faithful directed acyclic graph (DAG) from samples of a joint
  distribution is a challenging combinatorial problem, owing to the intractable search
  space superexponential in the number of graph nodes. A recent breakthrough formulates
  the problem as a continuous optimization with a structural constraint that ensures
  acyclicity (Zheng et al., 2018). The authors apply the approach to the linear structural
  equation model (SEM) and the least-squares loss function that are statistically
  well justified but nevertheless limited. Motivated by the widespread success of
  deep learning that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear mappings, in this work
  we propose a deep generative model and apply a variant of the structural constraint
  to learn the DAG. At the heart of the generative model is a variational autoencoder
  parameterized by a novel graph neural network architecture, which we coin DAG-GNN.
  In addition to the richer capacity, an advantage of the proposed model is that it
  naturally handles discrete variables as well as vector-valued ones. We demonstrate
  that on synthetic data sets, the proposed method learns more accurate graphs for
  nonlinearly generated samples; and on benchmark data sets with discrete variables,
  the learned graphs are reasonably close to the global optima. The code is available
  at \url{https://github.com/fishmoon1234/DAG-GNN}.
