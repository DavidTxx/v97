abstract: Encoder-decoder networks using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
  have been extensively used in deep learning literatures thanks to its excellent
  performance for various inverse problems in computer vision, medical imaging, etc.
  However, it is still difficult to obtain coherent geometric view why such an architecture
  gives the desired performance. Inspired by recent theoretical understanding on generalizability,
  expressivity and optimization landscape of neural networks, as well as the theory
  of convolutional framelets, here we provide a unified theoretical framework that
  leads to a better understanding of geometry of encoder-decoder CNNs. Our unified
  mathematical framework shows that encoder-decoder CNN architecture is closely related
  to nonlinear basis representation using combinatorial convolution frames, whose
  expressibility increases exponentially with the network depth. We also demonstrate
  the importance of skipped connection in terms of expressibility, and optimization
  landscape.
