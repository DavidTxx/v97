abstract: It is well-known that the expressivity of a neural network depends on its
  architecture, with deeper networks expressing more complex functions. In the case
  of networks that compute piecewise linear functions, such as those with ReLU activation,
  the number of distinct linear regions is a natural measure of expressivity. It is
  possible to construct networks with merely a single region, or for which the number
  of linear regions grows exponentially with depth; it is not clear where within this
  range most networks fall in practice, either before or after training. In this paper,
  we provide a mathematical framework to count the number of linear regions of a piecewise
  linear network and measure the volume of the boundaries between these regions. In
  particular, we prove that for networks at initialization, the average number of
  regions along any one-dimensional subspace grows linearly in the total number of
  neurons, far below the exponential upper bound. We also find that the average distance
  to the nearest region boundary at initialization scales like the inverse of the
  number of neurons. Our theory suggests that, even after training, the number of
  linear regions is far below exponential, an intuition that matches our empirical
  observations. We conclude that the practical expressivity of neural networks is
  likely far below that of the theoretical maximum, and that this gap can be quantified.
