abstract: Humans prove theorems by relying on substantial high-level reasoning and
  problem-specific insights. Proof assistants offer a formalism that resembles human
  mathematical reasoning, representing theorems in higher-order logic and proofs as
  high-level tactics. However, human experts have to construct proofs manually by
  entering tactics into the proof assistant. In this paper, we study the problem of
  using machine learning to automate the interaction with proof assistants. We construct
  CoqGym, a large-scale dataset and learning environment containing 71K human-written
  proofs from 123 projects developed with the Coq proof assistant. We develop ASTactic,
  a deep learning-based model that generates tactics as programs in the form of abstract
  syntax trees (ASTs). Experiments show that ASTactic trained on CoqGym can generate
  effective tactics and can be used to prove new theorems not previously provable
  by automated methods. Code is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/CoqGym.
