abstract: For reliable transmission across a noisy communication channel, classical
  results from information theory show that it is asymptotically optimal to separate
  out the source and channel coding processes. However, this decomposition can fall
  short in the finite bit-length regime, as it requires non-trivial tuning of hand-crafted
  codes and assumes infinite computational power for decoding. In this work, we propose
  to jointly learn the encoding and decoding processes using a new discrete variational
  autoencoder model. By adding noise into the latent codes to simulate the channel
  during training, we learn to both compress and error-correct given a fixed bit-length
  and computational budget. We obtain codes that are not only competitive against
  several separation schemes, but also learn useful robust representations of the
  data for downstream tasks such as classification. Finally, inference amortization
  yields an extremely fast neural decoder, almost an order of magnitude faster compared
  to standard decoding methods based on iterative belief propagation.
