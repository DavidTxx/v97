abstract: 'Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The literature
  is rich with algorithms that can easily craft successful adversarial examples. In
  contrast, the performance of defense techniques still lags behind. This paper proposes
  ME-Net, a defense method that leverages matrix estimation (ME). In ME-Net, images
  are preprocessed using two steps: first pixels are randomly dropped from the image;
  then, the image is reconstructed using ME. We show that this process destroys the
  adversarial structure of the noise, while re-enforcing the global structure in the
  original image. Since humans typically rely on such global structures in classifying
  images, the process makes the network mode compatible with human perception. We
  conduct comprehensive experiments on prevailing benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10,
  SVHN, and Tiny-ImageNet. Comparing ME-Net with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms
  shows that ME-Net consistently outperforms prior techniques, improving robustness
  against both black-box and white-box attacks.'
