abstract: We address the problem of unsupervised disentanglement of discrete and continuous
  explanatory factors of data. We first show a simple procedure for minimizing the
  total correlation of the continuous latent variables without having to use a discriminator
  network or perform importance sampling, via cascading the information flow in the
  beta-VAE framework. Furthermore, we propose a method which avoids offloading the
  entire burden of jointly modeling the continuous and discrete factors to the variational
  encoder by employing a separate discrete inference procedure. This leads to an interesting
  alternating minimization problem which switches between finding the most likely
  discrete configuration given the continuous factors and updating the variational
  encoder based on the computed discrete factors. Experiments show that the proposed
  method clearly disentangles discrete factors and significantly outperforms current
  disentanglement methods based on the disentanglement score and inference network
  classification score. The source code is available at https://github.com/snumllab/DisentanglementICML19.
