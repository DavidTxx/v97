abstract: We explore models for translating abstract musical ideas (scores, rhythms)
  into expressive performances using seq2seq and recurrent variational information
  bottleneck (VIB) models. Though seq2seq models usually require painstakingly aligned
  corpora, we show that it is possible to adapt an approach from the Generative Adversarial
  Network (GAN) literature (e.g. Pix2Pix, Vid2Vid) to sequences, creating large volumes
  of paired data by performing simple transformations and training generative models
  to plausibly invert these transformations. Music, and drumming in particular, provides
  a strong test case for this approach because many common transformations (quantization,
  removing voices) have clear semantics, and learning to invert them has real-world
  applications. Focusing on the case of drum set players, we create and release a
  new dataset for this purpose, containing over 13 hours of recordings by professional
  drummers aligned with fine-grained timing and dynamics information. We also explore
  some of the creative potential of these models, demonstrating improvements on state-of-the-art
  methods for Humanization (instantiating a performance from a musical score).
