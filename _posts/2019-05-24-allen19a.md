abstract: Word embeddings generated by neural network methods such as word2vec (W2V)
  are well known to exhibit seemingly linear behaviour, e.g. the embeddings of analogy
  “woman is to queen as man is to king” approximately describe a parallelogram. This
  property is particularly intriguing since the embeddings are not trained to achieve
  it. Several explanations have been proposed, but each introduces assumptions that
  do not hold in practice. We derive a probabilistically grounded definition of paraphrasing
  that we re-interpret as word transformation, a mathematical description of “$w_x$
  is to $w_y$”. From these concepts we prove existence of linear relationship between
  W2V-type embeddings that underlie the analogical phenomenon, identifying explicit
  error terms.
