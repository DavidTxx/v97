abstract: We introduce a new convolutional layer named the Temporal Gaussian Mixture
  (TGM) layer and present how it can be used to efficiently capture longer-term temporal
  information in continuous activity videos. The TGM layer is a temporal convolutional
  layer governed by a much smaller set of parameters (e.g., location/variance of Gaussians)
  that are fully differentiable. We present our fully convolutional video models with
  multiple TGM layers for activity detection. The extensive experiments on multiple
  datasets, including Charades and MultiTHUMOS, confirm the effectiveness of TGM layers,
  significantly outperforming the state-of-the-arts.
