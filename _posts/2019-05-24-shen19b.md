abstract: The problem of market clearing is to set a price for an item such that quantity
  demanded equals quantity supplied. In this work, we cast the problem of predicting
  clearing prices into a learning framework and use the resulting models to perform
  revenue optimization in auctions and markets with contextual information. The economic
  intuition behind market clearing allows us to obtain fine-grained control over the
  aggressiveness of the resulting pricing policy, grounded in theory. To evaluate
  our approach, we fit a model of clearing prices over a massive dataset of bids in
  display ad auctions from a major ad exchange. The learned prices outperform other
  modeling techniques in the literature in terms of revenue and efficiency trade-offs.
  Because of the convex nature of the clearing loss function, the convergence rate
  of our method is as fast as linear regression.
