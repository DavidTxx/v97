abstract: We propose a new architecture of the capsule network called the ladder capsule
  network, which has an alternative building block to the dynamic routing algorithm
  in the capsule network (Sabour et al., 2017). Motivated by the need for using only
  important capsules during training for robust performance, we first introduce a
  new layer called the pruning layer, which removes irrelevant capsules. Based on
  the selected capsules, we construct higher-level capsule outputs. Subsequently,
  to capture the part-whole spatial relationships, we introduce another new layer
  called the ladder layer, the outputs of which are regressed lower-level capsule
  outputs from higher-level capsules. Unlike the capsule network adopting the routing-by-agreement,
  the ladder capsule network uses backpropagation from a loss function to reconstruct
  the lower-level capsule outputs from higher-level capsules; thus, the ladder layer
  implements the reverse directional inference of the agreement/disagreement mechanism
  of the capsule network. The experiments on MNIST demonstrate that the ladder capsule
  network learns an equivariant representation and improves the capability to extrapolate
  or generalize to pose variations.
