abstract: Though deep neural networks have achieved significant progress on various
  tasks, often enhanced by model ensemble, existing high-performance models can be
  vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Many efforts have been devoted to enhancing the
  robustness of individual networks and then constructing a straightforward ensemble,
  e.g., by directly averaging the outputs, which ignores the interaction among networks.
  This paper presents a new method that explores the interaction among individual
  networks to improve robustness for ensemble models. Technically, we define a new
  notion of ensemble diversity in the adversarial setting as the diversity among non-maximal
  predictions of individual members, and present an adaptive diversity promoting (ADP)
  regularizer to encourage the diversity, which leads to globally better robustness
  for the ensemble by making adversarial examples difficult to transfer among individual
  members. Our method is computationally efficient and compatible with the defense
  methods acting on individual networks. Empirical results on various datasets verify
  that our method can improve adversarial robustness while maintaining state-of-the-art
  accuracy on normal examples.
