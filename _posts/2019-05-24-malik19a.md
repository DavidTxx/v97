abstract: Estimates of predictive uncertainty are important for accurate model-based
  planning and reinforcement learning. However, predictive uncertainties — especially
  ones derived from modern deep learning systems — can be inaccurate and impose a
  bottleneck on performance. This paper explores which uncertainties are needed for
  model-based reinforcement learning and argues that ideal uncertainties should be
  calibrated, i.e. their probabilities should match empirical frequencies of predicted
  events. We describe a simple way to augment any model-based reinforcement learning
  agent with a calibrated model and show that doing so consistently improves planning,
  sample complexity, and exploration. On the \textsc{HalfCheetah} MuJoCo task, our
  system achieves state-of-the-art performance using 50% fewer samples than the current
  leading approach. Our findings suggest that calibration can improve the performance
  of model-based reinforcement learning with minimal computational and implementation
  overhead.
