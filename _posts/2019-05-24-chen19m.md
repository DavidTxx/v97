abstract: Although adversarial examples and model robust-ness have been extensively
  studied in the context of neural networks, research on this issue in tree-based
  models and how to make tree-based models robust against adversarial examples is
  still limited. In this paper, we show that tree-based models are also vulnerable
  to adversarial examples and develop a novel algorithm to learn robust trees. At
  its core, our method aims to optimize the performance under the worst-case perturbation
  of input features, which leads to a max-min saddle point problem. Incorporating
  this saddle point objective into the decision tree building procedure is non-trivial
  due to the discrete nature of trees{â€”}a naive approach to finding the best split
  according to this saddle point objective will take exponential time. To make our
  approach practical and scalable, we propose efficient tree building algorithms by
  approximating the inner minimizer in the saddlepoint problem, and present efficient
  implementations for classical information gain based trees as well as state-of-the-art
  tree boosting systems such as XGBoost. Experimental results on real world datasets
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve the robustness
  of tree-based models against adversarial examples.
