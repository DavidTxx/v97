abstract: Stochastic blockmodels (SBM) and their variants, $e.g.$, mixed-membership
  and overlapping stochastic blockmodels, are latent variable based generative models
  for graphs. They have proven to be successful for various tasks, such as discovering
  the community structure and link prediction on graph-structured data. Recently,
  graph neural networks, $e.g.$, graph convolutional networks, have also emerged as
  a promising approach to learn powerful representations (embeddings) for the nodes
  in the graph, by exploiting graph properties such as locality and invariance. In
  this work, we unify these two directions by developing a <em>sparse</em> variational
  autoencoder for graphs, that retains the interpretability of SBMs, while also enjoying
  the excellent predictive performance of graph neural nets. Moreover, our framework
  is accompanied by a fast recognition model that enables fast inference of the node
  embeddings (which are of independent interest for inference in SBM and its variants).
  Although we develop this framework for a particular type of SBM, namely the <em>overlapping</em>
  stochastic blockmodel, the proposed framework can be adapted readily for other types
  of SBMs. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate encouraging results
  on link prediction while learning an interpretable latent structure that can be
  used for community discovery.
