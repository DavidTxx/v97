abstract: Mean embeddings provide an extremely flexible and powerful tool in machine
  learning and statistics to represent probability distributions and define a semi-metric
  (MMD, maximum mean discrepancy; also called N-distance or energy distance), with
  numerous successful applications. The representation is constructed as the expectation
  of the feature map defined by a kernel. As a mean, its classical empirical estimator,
  however, can be arbitrary severely affected even by a single outlier in case of
  unbounded features. To the best of our knowledge, unfortunately even the consistency
  of the existing few techniques trying to alleviate this serious sensitivity bottleneck
  is unknown. In this paper, we show how the recently emerged principle of median-of-means
  can be used to design estimators for kernel mean embedding and MMD with excessive
  resistance properties to outliers, and optimal sub-Gaussian deviation bounds under
  mild assumptions.
