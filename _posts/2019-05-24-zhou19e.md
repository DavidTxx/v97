abstract: One-Shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a promising method to significantly
  reduce search time without any separate training. It can be treated as a Network
  Compression problem on the architecture parameters from an over-parameterized network.
  However, there are two issues associated with most one-shot NAS methods. First,
  dependencies between a node and its predecessors and successors are often disregarded
  which result in improper treatment over zero operations. Second, architecture parameters
  pruning based on their magnitude is questionable. In this paper, we employ the classic
  Bayesian learning approach to alleviate these two issues by modeling architecture
  parameters using hierarchical automatic relevance determination (HARD) priors. Unlike
  other NAS methods, we train the over-parameterized network for only one epoch then
  update the architecture. Impressively, this enabled us to find the architecture
  in both proxy and proxyless tasks on CIFAR-10 within only 0.2 GPU days using a single
  GPU. As a byproduct, our approach can be transferred directly to compress convolutional
  neural networks by enforcing structural sparsity which achieves extremely sparse
  networks without accuracy deterioration.
