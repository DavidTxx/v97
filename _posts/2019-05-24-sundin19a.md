abstract: 'Machine learning can help personalized decision support by learning models
  to predict individual treatment effects (ITE). This work studies the reliability
  of prediction-based decision-making in a task of deciding which action $a$ to take
  for a target unit after observing its covariates $\tilde{x}$ and predicted outcomes
  $\hat{p}(\tilde{y} \mid \tilde{x}, a)$. An example case is personalized medicine
  and the decision of which treatment to give to a patient. A common problem when
  learning these models from observational data is imbalance, that is, difference
  in treated/control covariate distributions, which is known to increase the upper
  bound of the expected ITE estimation error. We propose to assess the decision-making
  reliability by estimating the ITE modelâ€™s Type S error rate, which is the probability
  of the model inferring the sign of the treatment effect wrong. Furthermore, we use
  the estimated reliability as a criterion for active learning, in order to collect
  new (possibly expensive) observations, instead of making a forced choice based on
  unreliable predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this decision-making
  aware active learning in two decision-making tasks: in simulated data with binary
  outcomes and in a medical dataset with synthetic and continuous treatment outcomes.'
