abstract: Graphs are used in almost every scientific discipline to express relations
  among a set of objects. Algorithms that compare graphs, and output a closeness score,
  or a correspondence among their nodes, are thus extremely important. Despite the
  large amount of work done, many o the scalable algorithms to compare graphs do not
  produce closeness scores that satisfy the intuitive properties of metrics. This
  is problematic since non-metrics are known to degrade the performance of algorithms
  such as distance-based clustering of graphs (Bento & Ioannidis, 2018). On the other
  hand, the use of metrics increases the performance of several machine learning tasks
  (Indyk, 1999; Clarkson, 1999; Angiulli & Pizzuti, 2002; Ackermann et al., 2010).
  In this paper, we introduce a new family of multi-distances (a distance between
  more than two elements) that satisfies a generalization of the properties of metrics
  to multiple elements. In the context of comparing graphs, we are the first to show
  the existence of multi-distances that simultaneously incorporate the useful property
  of alignment consistency (Nguyenet al., 2011), and a generalized metric property.
  Furthermore, we show that these multi-distances can be relaxed to convex optimization
  problems, without losing the generalized metric property.
