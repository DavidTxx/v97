abstract: Many machine learning problems come in the form of networks with relational
  data between entities, and one of the key unsupervised learning tasks is to detect
  communities in such a network. We adopt the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel
  as the underlying probabilistic model, and give conditions under which the memberships
  of a subset of nodes can be uniquely identified. Our method starts by constructing
  a second-order graph moment, which can be shown to converge to a specific product
  of the true parameters as the size of the network increases. To correctly recover
  the true membership parameters, we formulate an optimization problem using insights
  from convex geometry. We show that if the true memberships satisfy a so-called sufficiently
  scattered condition, then solving the proposed problem correctly identifies the
  ground truth. We also propose an efficient algorithm for detecting communities,
  which is significantly faster than prior work and with better convergence properties.
  Experiments on synthetic and real data justify the validity of the proposed learning
  framework for network data.
