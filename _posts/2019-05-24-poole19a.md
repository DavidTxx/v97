abstract: Estimating and optimizing Mutual Information (MI) is core to many problems
  in machine learning, but bounding MI in high dimensions is challenging. To establish
  tractable and scalable objectives, recent work has turned to variational bounds
  parameterized by neural networks. However, the relationships and tradeoffs between
  these bounds remains unclear. In this work, we unify these recent developments in
  a single framework. We find that the existing variational lower bounds degrade when
  the MI is large, exhibiting either high bias or high variance. To address this problem,
  we introduce a continuum of lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and flexibly
  trades off bias and variance. On high-dimensional, controlled problems, we empirically
  characterize the bias and variance of the bounds and their gradients and demonstrate
  the effectiveness of these new bounds for estimation and representation learning.
