abstract: 'We present a novel technique for tailoring Bayesian quadrature (BQ) to
  model selection. The state-of-the-art for comparing the evidence of multiple models
  relies on Monte Carlo methods, which converge slowly and are unreliable for computationally
  expensive models. Although previous research has shown that BQ offers sample efficiency
  superior to Monte Carlo in computing the evidence of an individual model, applying
  BQ directly to model comparison may waste computation producing an overly-accurate
  estimate for the evidence of a clearly poor model. We propose an automated and efficient
  algorithm for computing the most-relevant quantity for model selection: the posterior
  model probability. Our technique maximizes the mutual information between this quantity
  and observations of the modelsâ€™ likelihoods, yielding efficient sample acquisition
  across disparate model spaces when likelihood observations are limited. Our method
  produces more-accurate posterior estimates using fewer likelihood evaluations than
  standard Bayesian quadrature and Monte Carlo estimators, as we demonstrate on synthetic
  and real-world examples.'
