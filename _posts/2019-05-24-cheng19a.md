abstract: Dealing with high variance is a significant challenge in model-free reinforcement
  learning (RL). Existing methods are unreliable, exhibiting high variance in performance
  from run to run using different initializations/seeds. Focusing on problems arising
  in continuous control, we propose a functional regularization approach to augmenting
  model-free RL. In particular, we regularize the behavior of the deep policy to be
  similar to a policy prior, i.e., we regularize in function space. We show that functional
  regularization yields a bias-variance trade-off, and propose an adaptive tuning
  strategy to optimize this trade-off. When the policy prior has control-theoretic
  stability guarantees, we further show that this regularization approximately preserves
  those stability guarantees throughout learning. We validate our approach empirically
  on a range of settings, and demonstrate significantly reduced variance, guaranteed
  dynamic stability, and more efficient learning than deep RL alone.
