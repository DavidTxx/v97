abstract: Importance weighted variational inference (Burda et al., 2015) uses multiple
  i.i.d. samples to have a tighter variational lower bound. We believe a joint proposal
  has the potential of reducing the number of redundant samples, and introduce a hierarchical
  structure to induce correlation. The hope is that the proposals would coordinate
  to make up for the error made by one another to reduce the variance of the importance
  estimator. Theoretically, we analyze the condition under which convergence of the
  estimator variance can be connected to convergence of the lower bound. Empirically,
  we confirm that maximization of the lower bound does implicitly minimize variance.
  Further analysis shows that this is a result of negative correlation induced by
  the proposed hierarchical meta sampling scheme, and performance of inference also
  improves when the number of samples increases.
