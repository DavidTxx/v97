abstract: Increasingly complex datasets pose a number of challenges for Bayesian inference.
  Conventional posterior sampling based on Markov chain Monte Carlo can be too computationally
  intensive, is serial in nature and mixes poorly between posterior modes. Furthermore,
  all models are misspecified, which brings into question the validity of the conventional
  Bayesian update. We present a scalable Bayesian nonparametric learning routine that
  enables posterior sampling through the optimization of suitably randomized objective
  functions. A Dirichlet process prior on the unknown data distribution accounts for
  model misspecification, and admits an embarrassingly parallel posterior bootstrap
  algorithm that generates independent and exact samples from the nonparametric posterior
  distribution. Our method is particularly adept at sampling from multimodal posterior
  distributions via a random restart mechanism, and we demonstrate this on Gaussian
  mixture model and sparse logistic regression examples.
