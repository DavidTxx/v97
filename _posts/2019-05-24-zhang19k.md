abstract: The likelihood model of high dimensional data $X_n$ can often be expressed
  as $p(X_n|Z_n,\theta)$, where $\theta\mathrel{\mathop:}=(\theta_k)_{k\in[K]}$ is
  a collection of hidden features shared across objects, indexed by $n$, and $Z_n$
  is a non-negative factor loading vector with $K$ entries where $Z_{nk}$ indicates
  the strength of $\theta_k$ used to express $X_n$. In this paper, we introduce random
  function priors for $Z_n$ for modeling correlations among its $K$ dimensions $Z_{n1}$
  through $Z_{nK}$, which we call <em>population random measure embedding</em> (PRME).
  Our model can be viewed as a generalized paintbox modelÂ \cite{Broderick13} using
  random functions, and can be learned efficiently with neural networks via amortized
  variational inference. We derive our Bayesian nonparametric method by applying a
  representation theorem on separately exchangeable discrete random measures.
