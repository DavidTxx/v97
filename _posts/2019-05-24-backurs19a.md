abstract: We study the fair variant of the classic k-median problem introduced by
  (Chierichetti et al., NeurIPS 2017) in which the points are colored, and the goal
  is to minimize the same average distance objective as in the standard $k$-median
  problem while ensuring that all clusters have an “approximately equal” number of
  points of each color. (Chierichetti et al., NeurIPS 2017) proposed a two-phase algorithm
  for fair $k$-clustering. In the first step, the pointset is partitioned into subsets
  called fairlets that satisfy the fairness requirement and approximately preserve
  the k-median objective. In the second step, fairlets are merged into k clusters
  by one of the existing k-median algorithms. The running time of this algorithm is
  dominated by the first step, which takes super-quadratic time. In this paper, we
  present a practical approximate fairlet decomposition algorithm that runs in nearly
  linear time.
