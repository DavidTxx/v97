abstract: Particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have gained attention
  in the Bayesian inference literature, for their capacity to yield flexible and accurate
  approximations. We explore ParVIs from the perspective of Wasserstein gradient flows,
  and make both theoretical and practical contributions. We unify various finite-particle
  approximations that existing ParVIs use, and recognize that the approximation is
  essentially a compulsory smoothing treatment, in either of two equivalent forms.
  This novel understanding reveals the assumptions and relations of existing ParVIs,
  and also inspires new ParVIs. We propose an acceleration framework and a principled
  bandwidth-selection method for general ParVIs; these are based on the developed
  theory and leverage the geometry of the Wasserstein space. Experimental results
  show the improved convergence by the acceleration framework and enhanced sample
  accuracy by the bandwidth-selection method.
