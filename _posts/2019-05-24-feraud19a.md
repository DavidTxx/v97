abstract: 'We consider the decentralized exploration problem: a set of players collaborate
  to identify the best arm by asynchronously interacting with the same stochastic
  environment. The objective is to insure privacy in the best arm identification problem
  between asynchronous, collaborative, and thrifty players. In the context of a digital
  service, we advocate that this decentralized approach allows a good balance between
  conflicting interests: the providers optimize their services, while protecting privacy
  of users and saving resources. We define the privacy level as the amount of information
  an adversary could infer by intercepting all the messages concerning a single user.
  We provide a generic algorithm DECENTRALIZED ELIMINATION, which uses any best arm
  identification algorithm as a subroutine. We prove that this algorithm insures privacy,
  with a low communication cost, and that in comparison to the lower bound of the
  best arm identification problem, its sample complexity suffers from a penalty depending
  on the inverse of the probability of the most frequent players. Then, thanks to
  the genericity of the approach, we extend the proposed algorithm to the non-stationary
  bandits. Finally, experiments illustrate and complete the analysis.'
