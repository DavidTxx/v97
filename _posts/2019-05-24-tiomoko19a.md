abstract: Relying on recent advances in statistical estimation of covariance distances
  based on random matrix theory, this article proposes an improved covariance and
  precision matrix estimation for a wide family of metrics. The method is shown to
  largely outperform the sample covariance matrix estimate and to compete with state-of-the-art
  methods, while at the same time being computationally simpler and faster. Applications
  to linear and quadratic discriminant analyses also show significant gains, therefore
  suggesting practical interest to statistical machine learning.
