abstract: 'A long-standing problem in stochastic optimization is proving that \rsgd,
  the without-replacement version of \sgd, converges faster than the usual with-replacement
  \sgd. Building uponÂ \citep{gurbuzbalaban2015random}, we present the <em>first</em>
  (to our knowledge) non-asymptotic results for this problem by proving that after
  a reasonable number of epochs \rsgd converges faster than \sgd. Specifically, we
  prove that for strongly convex, second-order smooth functions, the iterates of \rsgd
  converge to the optimal solution as $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{T^2} + \nicefrac{n^3}{T^3})$,
  where $n$ is the number of components in the objective, and $T$ is number of iterations.
  This result implies that after $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ epochs, \rsgd is <em>strictly
  better</em> than \sgd (which converges as $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{T})$). The key
  step toward showing this better dependence on $T$ is the introduction of $n$ into
  the bound; and as our analysis shows, in general a dependence on $n$ is unavoidable
  without further changes. To understand how \rsgd works in practice, we further explore
  two empirically useful settings: data sparsity and over-parameterization. For sparse
  data, \rsgd has the rate $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}\right)$, again strictly
  better than \sgd. Under a setting closely related to over-parameterization, \rsgd
  is shown to converge faster than \sgd after any <em>arbitrary</em> number of iterations.
  Finally, we extend the analysis of \rsgd to smooth non-convex and convex functions.'
