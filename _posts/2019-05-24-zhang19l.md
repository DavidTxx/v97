abstract: Generalized zero-shot learning is a significant topic but faced with bias
  problem, which leads to unseen classes being easily misclassified into seen classes.
  Hence we propose a embedding model called co-representation network to learn a more
  uniform visual embedding space that effectively alleviates the bias problem and
  helps with classification. We mathematically analyze our model and find it learns
  a projection with high local linearity, which is proved to cause less bias problem.
  The network consists of a cooperation module for representation and a relation module
  for classification, it is simple in structure and can be easily trained in an end-to-end
  manner. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing generalized zero-shot
  learning methods on several benchmark datasets.
