abstract: We identify a phenomenon, which we refer to as multi-model forgetting, that
  occurs when sequentially training multiple deep networks with partially-shared parameters;
  the performance of previously-trained models degrades as one optimizes a subsequent
  one, due to the overwriting of shared parameters. To overcome this, we introduce
  a statistically-justified weight plasticity loss that regularizes the learning of
  a modelâ€™s shared parameters according to their importance for the previous models,
  and demonstrate its effectiveness when training two models sequentially and for
  neural architecture search. Adding weight plasticity in neural architecture search
  preserves the best models to the end of the search and yields improved results in
  both natural language processing and computer vision tasks.
