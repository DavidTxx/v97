abstract: Bayesian optimization is known to be difficult to scale to high dimensions,
  because the acquisition step requires solving a non-convex optimization problem
  in the same search space. In order to scale the method and keep its benefits, we
  propose an algorithm (LineBO) that restricts the problem to a sequence of iteratively
  chosen one-dimensional sub-problems that can be solved efficiently. We show that
  our algorithm converges globally and obtains a fast local rate when the function
  is strongly convex. Further, if the objective has an invariant subspace, our method
  automatically adapts to the effective dimension without changing the algorithm.
  When combined with the SafeOpt algorithm to solve the sub-problems, we obtain the
  first safe Bayesian optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees applicable
  in high-dimensional settings. We evaluate our method on multiple synthetic benchmarks,
  where we obtain competitive performance. Further, we deploy our algorithm to optimize
  the beam intensity of the Swiss Free Electron Laser with up to 40 parameters while
  satisfying safe operation constraints.
