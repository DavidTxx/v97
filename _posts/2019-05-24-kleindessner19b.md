abstract: Given the widespread popularity of spectral clustering (SC) for partitioning
  graph data, we study a version of constrained SC in which we try to incorporate
  the fairness notion proposed by Chierichetti et al. (2017). According to this notion,
  a clustering is fair if every demographic group is approximately proportionally
  represented in each cluster. To this end, we develop variants of both normalized
  and unnormalized constrained SC and show that they help find fairer clusterings
  on both synthetic and real data. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
  of our algorithms on a natural variant of the stochastic block model, where $h$
  groups have strong inter-group connectivity, but also exhibit a “natural” clustering
  structure which is fair. We prove that our algorithms can recover this fair clustering
  with high probability.
