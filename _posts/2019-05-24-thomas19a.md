abstract: In this paper we derive new concentration inequalities for the conditional
  value at risk (CVaR) of a random variable, and compare them to the previous state
  of the art (Brown, 2007). We show analytically that our lower bound is strictly
  tighter than Brown’s, and empirically that this difference is significant. While
  our upper bound may be looser than Brown’s in some cases, we show empirically that
  in most cases our bound is significantly tighter. After discussing when each upper
  bound is superior, we conclude with empirical results which suggest that both of
  our bounds will often be significantly tighter than Brown’s.
