abstract: 'We present an approach to analyze $C^1(\mathbb{R}^m)$ functions that addresses
  limitations present in the Active Subspaces (AS) method of Constantine et al. (2014;
  2015). Under appropriate hypotheses, our Active Manifolds (AM) method identifies
  a 1-D curve in the domain (the active manifold) on which nearly all values of the
  unknown function are attained, which can be exploited for approximation or analysis,
  especially when $m$ is large (high-dimensional input space). We provide theorems
  justifying our AM technique and an algorithm permitting functional approximation
  and sensitivity analysis. Using accessible, low-dimensional functions as initial
  examples, we show AM reduces approximation error by an order of magnitude compared
  to AS, at the expense of more computation. Following this, we revisit the sensitivity
  analysis by Glaws et al. (2017), who apply AS to analyze a magnetohydrodynamic power
  generator model, and compare the performance of AM on the same data. Our analysis
  provides detailed information not captured by AS, exhibiting the influence of each
  parameter individually along an active manifold. Overall, AM represents a novel
  technique for analyzing functional models with benefits including: reducing $m$-dimensional
  analysis to a 1-D analogue, permitting more accurate regression than AS (at more
  computational expense), enabling more informative sensitivity analysis, and granting
  accessible visualizations (2-D plots) of parameter sensitivity along the AM.'
