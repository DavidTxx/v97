abstract: The Weisfeiler–Lehman graph kernel exhibits competitive performance in many
  graph classification tasks. However, its subtree features are not able to capture
  connected components and cycles, topological features known for characterising graphs.
  To extract such features, we leverage propagated node label information and transform
  unweighted graphs into metric ones. This permits us to augment the subtree features
  with topological information obtained using persistent homology, a concept from
  topological data analysis. Our method, which we formalise as a generalisation of
  Weisfeiler–Lehman subtree features, exhibits favourable classification accuracy
  and its improvements in predictive performance are mainly driven by including cycle
  information.
