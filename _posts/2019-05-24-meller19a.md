abstract: Quantization of neural networks has become common practice, driven by the
  need for efficient implementations of deep neural networks on embedded devices.
  In this paper, we exploit an oft-overlooked degree of freedom in most networks -
  for a given layer, individual output channels can be scaled by any factor provided
  that the corresponding weights of the next layer are inversely scaled. Therefore,
  a given network has many factorizations which change the weights of the network
  without changing its function. We present a conceptually simple and easy to implement
  method that uses this property and show that proper factorizations significantly
  decrease the degradation caused by quantization. We show improvement on a wide variety
  of networks and achieve state-of-the-art degradation results for MobileNets. While
  our focus is on quantization, this type of factorization is applicable to other
  domains such as network-pruning, neural nets regularization and network interpretability.
