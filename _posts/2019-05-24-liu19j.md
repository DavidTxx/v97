abstract: It is known that the Langevin dynamics used in MCMC is the gradient flow
  of the KL divergence on the Wasserstein space, which helps convergence analysis
  and inspires recent particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs). But no
  more MCMC dynamics is understood in this way. In this work, by developing novel
  concepts, we propose a theoretical framework that recognizes a general MCMC dynamics
  as the fiber-gradient Hamiltonian flow on the Wasserstein space of a fiber-Riemannian
  Poisson manifold. The "conservation + convergence" structure of the flow gives a
  clear picture on the behavior of general MCMC dynamics. The framework also enables
  ParVI simulation of MCMC dynamics, which enriches the ParVI family with more efficient
  dynamics, and also adapts ParVI advantages to MCMCs. We develop two ParVI methods
  for a particular MCMC dynamics and demonstrate the benefits in experiments.
