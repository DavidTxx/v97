abstract: We propose a framework to learn deep generative models via \textbf{V}ariational
  \textbf{Gr}adient Fl\textbf{ow} (VGrow) on probability spaces. The evolving distribution
  that asymptotically converges to the target distribution is governed by a vector
  field, which is the negative gradient of the first variation of the $f$-divergence
  between them. We prove that the evolving distribution coincides with the pushforward
  distribution through the infinitesimal time composition of residual maps that are
  perturbations of the identity map along the vector field. The vector field depends
  on the density ratio of the pushforward distribution and the target distribution,
  which can be consistently learned from a binary classification problem. Connections
  of our proposed VGrow method with other popular methods, such as VAE, GAN and flow-based
  methods, have been established in this framework, gaining new insights of deep generative
  learning. We also evaluated several commonly used divergences, including Kullback-Leibler,
  Jensen-Shannon, Jeffreys divergences as well as our newly discovered “logD” divergence
  which serves as the objective function of the logD-trick GAN. Experimental results
  on benchmark datasets demonstrate that VGrow can generate high-fidelity images in
  a stable and efficient manner, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art
  GANs.
