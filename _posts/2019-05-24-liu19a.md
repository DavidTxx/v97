abstract: Empirical risk minimization is an important class of optimization problems
  with many popular machine learning applications, and stochastic variance reduction
  methods are popular choices for solving them. Among these methods, SVRG and Katyusha
  X (a Nesterov accelerated SVRG) achieve fast convergence without substantial memory
  requirement. In this paper, we propose to accelerate these two algorithms by <em>inexact
  preconditioning</em>, the proposed methods employ <em>fixed</em> preconditioners,
  although the subproblem in each epoch becomes harder, it suffices to apply <em>fixed</em>
  number of simple subroutines to solve it inexactly, without losing the overall convergence.
  As a result, this inexact preconditioning strategy gives provably better iteration
  complexity and gradient complexity over SVRG and Katyusha X. We also allow each
  function in the finite sum to be nonconvex while the sum is strongly convex. In
  our numerical experiments, we observe an on average $8\times$ speedup on the number
  of iterations and $7\times$ speedup on runtime.
