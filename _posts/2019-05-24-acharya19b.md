abstract: 'In distributed statistical learning, $N$ samples are split across $m$ machines
  and a learner wishes to use minimal communication to learn as well as if the examples
  were on a single machine. This model has received substantial interest in machine
  learning due to its scalability and potential for parallel speedup. However, in
  high-dimensional settings, where the number examples is smaller than the number
  of features (â€˜"dimension"), the speedup afforded by distributed learning may be
  overshadowed by the cost of communicating a single example. This paper investigates
  the following question: When is it possible to learn a $d$-dimensional model in
  the distributed setting with total communication sublinear in $d$? Starting with
  a negative result, we observe that for learning $\ell_1$-bounded or sparse linear
  models, no algorithm can obtain optimal error until communication is linear in dimension.
  Our main result is that by slightly relaxing the standard boundedness assumptions
  for linear models, we can obtain distributed algorithms that enjoy optimal error
  with communication <em>logarithmic</em> in dimension. This result is based on a
  family of algorithms that combine mirror descent with randomized sparsification/quantization
  of iterates, and extends to the general stochastic convex optimization model.'
