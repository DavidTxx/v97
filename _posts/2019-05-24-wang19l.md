abstract: When the performance of a machine learning model varies over groups defined
  by sensitive attributes (e.g., gender or ethnicity), the performance disparity can
  be expressed in terms of the probability distributions of the input and output variables
  over each group. In this paper, we exploit this fact to reduce the disparate impact
  of a fixed classification model over a population of interest. Given a black-box
  classifier, we aim to eliminate the performance gap by perturbing the distribution
  of input variables for the disadvantaged group. We refer to the perturbed distribution
  as a counterfactual distribution, and characterize its properties for common fairness
  criteria. We introduce a descent algorithm to learn a counterfactual distribution
  from data. We then discuss how the estimated distribution can be used to build a
  data preprocessor that can reduce disparate impact without training a new model.
  We validate our approach through experiments on real-world datasets, showing that
  it can repair different forms of disparity without a significant drop in accuracy.
