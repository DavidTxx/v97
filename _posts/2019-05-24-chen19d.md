abstract: We extend the fair machine learning literature by considering the problem
  of proportional centroid clustering in a metric context. For clustering n points
  with k centers, we define fairness as proportionality to mean that any n/k points
  are entitled to form their own cluster if there is another center that is closer
  in distance for all n/k points. We seek clustering solutions to which there are
  no such justified complaints from any subsets of agents, without assuming any a
  priori notion of protected subsets. We present and analyze algorithms to efficiently
  compute, optimize, and audit proportional solutions. We conclude with an empirical
  examination of the tradeoff between proportional solutions and the k-means objective.
