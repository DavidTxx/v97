abstract: Stochastic variational inference is an established way to carry out approximate
  Bayesian inference for deep models flexibly and at scale. While there have been
  effective proposals for good initializations for loss minimization in deep learning,
  far less attention has been devoted to the issue of initialization of stochastic
  variational inference. We address this by proposing a novel layer-wise initialization
  strategy based on Bayesian linear models. The proposed method is extensively validated
  on regression and classification tasks, including Bayesian Deep Nets and Conv Nets,
  showing faster and better convergence compared to alternatives inspired by the literature
  on initializations for loss minimization.
