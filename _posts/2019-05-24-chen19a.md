abstract: We establish the first nonasymptotic error bounds for Kaplan-Meier-based
  nearest neighbor and kernel survival probability estimators where feature vectors
  reside in metric spaces. Our bounds imply rates of strong consistency for these
  nonparametric estimators and, up to a log factor, match an existing lower bound
  for conditional CDF estimation. Our proof strategy also yields nonasymptotic guarantees
  for nearest neighbor and kernel variants of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazards
  estimator. We experimentally compare these methods on four datasets. We find that
  for the kernel survival estimator, a good choice of kernel is one learned using
  random survival forests.
