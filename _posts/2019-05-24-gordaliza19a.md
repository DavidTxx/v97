abstract: In the fair classification setup, we recast the links between fairness and
  predictability in terms of probability metrics. We analyze repair methods based
  on mapping conditional distributions to the Wasserstein barycenter. We propose a
  Random Repair which yields a tradeoff between minimal information loss and a certain
  amount of fairness.
