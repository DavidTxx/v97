abstract: Due to the ease of modern data collection, applied statisticians often have
  access to a large set of covariates that they wish to relate to some observed outcome.
  Generalized linear models (GLMs) offer a particularly interpretable framework for
  such an analysis. In these high-dimensional problems, the number of covariates is
  often large relative to the number of observations, so we face non-trivial inferential
  uncertainty; a Bayesian approach allows coherent quantification of this uncertainty.
  Unfortunately, existing methods for Bayesian inference in GLMs require running times
  roughly cubic in parameter dimension, and so are limited to settings with at most
  tens of thousand parameters. We propose to reduce time and memory costs with a low-rank
  approximation of the data in an approach we call LR-GLM. When used with the Laplace
  approximation or Markov chain Monte Carlo, LR-GLM provides a full Bayesian posterior
  approximation and admits running times reduced by a full factor of the parameter
  dimension. We rigorously establish the quality of our approximation and show how
  the choice of rank allows a tunable computationalâ€“statistical trade-off. Experiments
  support our theory and demonstrate the efficacy of LR-GLM on real large-scale datasets.
