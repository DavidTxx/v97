abstract: The weight initialization and the activation function of deep neural networks
  have a crucial impact on the performance of the training procedure. An inappropriate
  selection can lead to the loss of information of the input during forward propagation
  and the exponential vanishing/exploding of gradients during back-propagation. Understanding
  the theoretical properties of untrained random networks is key to identifying which
  deep networks may be trained successfully as recently demonstrated by Samuel et
  al. (2017) who showed that for deep feedforward neural networks only a specific
  choice of hyperparameters known as the ‘Edge of Chaos’ can lead to good performance.
  While the work by Samuel et al. (2017) discuss trainability issues, we focus here
  on training acceleration and overall performance. We give a comprehensive theoretical
  analysis of the Edge of Chaos and show that we can indeed tune the initialization
  parameters and the activation function in order to accelerate the training and improve
  the performance.
