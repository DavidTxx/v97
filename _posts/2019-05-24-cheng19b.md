abstract: 'We present a predictor-corrector framework, called PicCoLO, that can transform
  a first-order model-free reinforcement or imitation learning algorithm into a new
  hybrid method that leverages predictive models to accelerate policy learning. The
  new “PicCoLOed” algorithm optimizes a policy by recursively repeating two steps:
  In the Prediction Step, the learner uses a model to predict the unseen future gradient
  and then applies the predicted estimate to update the policy; in the Correction
  Step, the learner runs the updated policy in the environment, receives the true
  gradient, and then corrects the policy using the gradient error. Unlike previous
  algorithms, PicCoLO corrects for the mistakes of using imperfect predicted gradients
  and hence does not suffer from model bias. The development of PicCoLO is made possible
  by a novel reduction from predictable online learning to adversarial online learning,
  which provides a systematic way to modify existing first-order algorithms to achieve
  the optimal regret with respect to predictable information. We show, in both theory
  and simulation, that the convergence rate of several first-order model-free algorithms
  can be improved by PicCoLO.'
