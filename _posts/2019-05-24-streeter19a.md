abstract: We present algorithms for efficiently learning regularizers that improve
  generalization. Our approach is based on the insight that regularizers can be viewed
  as upper bounds on the generalization gap, and that reducing the slack in the bound
  can improve performance on test data. For a broad class of regularizers, the hyperparameters
  that give the best upper bound can be computed using linear programming. Under certain
  Bayesian assumptions, solving the LP lets us "jump" to the optimal hyperparameters
  given very limited data. This suggests a natural algorithm for tuning regularization
  hyperparameters, which we show to be effective on both real and synthetic data.
