abstract: 'Most structure inference methods either rely on exhaustive search or are
  purely data-driven. Exhaustive search robustly infers the structure of arbitrarily
  complex data, but it is slow. Data-driven methods allow efficient inference, but
  do not generalize when test data have more complex structures than training data.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid inference algorithm, the Neurally-Guided Structure
  Inference (NG-SI), keeping the advantages of both search-based and data-driven methods.
  The key idea of NG-SI is to use a neural network to guide the hierarchical, layer-wise
  search over the compositional space of structures. We evaluate our algorithm on
  two representative structure inference tasks: probabilistic matrix decomposition
  and symbolic program parsing. It outperforms data-driven and search-based alternatives
  on both tasks.'
