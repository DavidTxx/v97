abstract: 'Deep learning models have demonstrated outstanding performance in several
  problems, but their training process tends to require immense amounts of computational
  and human resources for training and labeling, constraining the types of problems
  that can be tackled. Therefore, the design of effective training methods that require
  small labeled training sets is an important research direction that will allow a
  more effective use of resources. Among current approaches designed to address this
  issue, two are particularly interesting: data augmentation and active learning.
  Data augmentation achieves this goal by artificially generating new training points,
  while active learning relies on the selection of the “most informative” subset of
  unlabeled training samples to be labelled by an oracle. Although successful in practice,
  data augmentation can waste computational resources because it indiscriminately
  generates samples that are not guaranteed to be informative, and active learning
  selects a small subset of informative samples (from a large un-annotated set) that
  may be insufficient for the training process. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
  generative active deep learning approach that combines active learning with data
  augmentation – we provide theoretical and empirical evidence (MNIST, CIFAR-$\{10,100\}$,
  and SVHN) that our approach has more efficient training and better classification
  results than data augmentation and active learning.'
