abstract: Deep neural networks and decision trees operate on largely separate paradigms;
  typically, the former performs representation learning with pre-specified architectures,
  while the latter is characterised by learning hierarchies over pre-specified features
  with data-driven architectures. We unite the two via adaptive neural trees (ANTs),
  a model that incorporates representation learning into edges, routing functions
  and leaf nodes of a decision tree, along with a backpropagation-based training algorithm
  that adaptively grows the architecture from primitive modules (e.g., convolutional
  layers). We demonstrate that, whilst achieving competitive performance on classification
  and regression datasets, ANTs benefit from (i) lightweight inference via conditional
  computation, (ii) hierarchical separation of features useful to the predictive task
  e.g. learning meaningful class associations, such as separating natural vs. man-made
  objects, and (iii) a mechanism to adapt the architecture to the size and complexity
  of the training dataset.
