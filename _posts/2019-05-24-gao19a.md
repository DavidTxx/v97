abstract: We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Convolutional
  neural networks can naturally operate on images, but have significant challenges
  in dealing with graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes
  lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image
  pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures
  like U-Nets have been successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks,
  similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling
  and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges,
  we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this
  work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based
  on their scalar projection values on a trainable projection vector. We further propose
  the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer
  restores the graph into its original structure using the position information of
  nodes selected in the corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and
  gUnpool layers, we develop an encoder-decoder model on graph, known as the graph
  U-Nets. Our experimental results on node classification and graph classification
  tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve consistently better performance than
  previous models.
