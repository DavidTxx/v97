abstract: 'As machine learning algorithms move into real-world settings, it is crucial
  to ensure they are aligned with societal values. There has been much work on one
  aspect of this, namely the discriminatory prediction problem: How can we reduce
  discrimination in the predictions themselves? While an important question, solutions
  to this problem only apply in a restricted setting, as we have full control over
  the predictions. Often we care about the non-discrimination of quantities we do
  not have full control over. Thus, we describe another key aspect of this challenge,
  the discriminatory impact problem: How can we reduce discrimination arising from
  the real-world impact of decisions? To address this, we describe causal methods
  that model the relevant parts of the real-world system in which the decisions are
  made. Unlike previous approaches, these models not only allow us to map the causal
  pathway of a single decision, but also to model the effect of interferenceâ€“how the
  impact on an individual depends on decisions made about other people. Often, the
  goal of decision policies is to maximize a beneficial impact overall. To reduce
  the discrimination of these benefits, we devise a constraint inspired by recent
  work in counterfactual fairness, and give an efficient procedure to solve the constrained
  optimization problem. We demonstrate our approach with an example: how to increase
  students taking college entrance exams in New York City public schools.'
