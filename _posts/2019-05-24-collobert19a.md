abstract: We introduce a new beam search decoder that is fully differentiable, making
  it possible to optimize at training time through the inference procedure. Our decoder
  allows us to combine models which operate at different granularities (e.g. acoustic
  and language models). It can be used when target sequences are not aligned to input
  sequences by considering all possible alignments between the two. We demonstrate
  our approach scales by applying it to speech recognition, jointly training acoustic
  and word-level language models. The system is end-to-end, with gradients flowing
  through the whole architecture from the word-level transcriptions. Recent research
  efforts have shown that deep neural networks with attention-based mechanisms can
  successfully train an acoustic model from the final transcription, while implicitly
  learning a language model. Instead, we show that it is possible to discriminatively
  train an acoustic model jointly with an <em>explicit</em> and possibly pre-trained
  language model.
