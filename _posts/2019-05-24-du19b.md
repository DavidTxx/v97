abstract: We study the exploration problem in episodic MDPs with rich observations
  generated from a small number of latent states. Under certain identifiability assumptions,
  we demonstrate how to estimate a mapping from the observations to latent states
  inductively through a sequence of regression and clustering steps—where previously
  decoded latent states provide labels for later regression problems—and use it to
  construct good exploration policies. We provide finite-sample guarantees on the
  quality of the learned state decoding function and exploration policies, and complement
  our theory with an empirical evaluation on a class of hard exploration problems.
  Our method exponentially improves over $Q$-learning with naïve exploration, even
  when $Q$-learning has cheating access to latent states.
