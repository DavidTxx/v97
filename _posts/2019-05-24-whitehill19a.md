abstract: 'Automatic machine learning-based detectors of various psychological and
  social phenomena (e.g., emotion, stress, engagement) have great potential to advance
  basic science. However, when a detector d is trained to approximate an existing
  measurement tool (e.g., a questionnaire, observation protocol), then care must be
  taken when interpreting measurements collected using d since they are one step further
  removed from the under- lying construct. We examine how the accuracy of d, as quantified
  by the correlation q of d’s out- puts with the ground-truth construct U, impacts
  the estimated correlation between U (e.g., stress) and some other phenomenon V (e.g.,
  academic performance). In particular: (1) We show that if the true correlation between
  U and V is r, then the expected sample correlation, over all vectors T n whose correlation
  with U is q, is qr. (2) We derive a formula for the probability that the sample
  correlation (over n subjects) using d is positive given that the true correlation
  is negative (and vice-versa); this probability can be substantial (around 20 - 30%)
  for values of n and q that have been used in recent affective computing studies.
  (3) With the goal to reduce the variance of correlations estimated by an automatic
  detector, we show that training multiple neural networks d(1) , . . . , d(m) using
  different training architectures and hyperparameters for the same detection task
  provides only limited “coverage” of T^n.'
