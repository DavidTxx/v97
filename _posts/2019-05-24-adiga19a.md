abstract: We consider the PAC learnability of the local functions at the vertices
  of a discrete networked dynamical system, assuming that the underlying network is
  known. Our focus is on the learnability of threshold functions. We show that several
  variants of threshold functions are PAC learnable and provide tight bounds on the
  sample complexity. In general, when the input consists of positive and negative
  examples, we show that the concept class of threshold functions is not efficiently
  PAC learnable, unless NP = RP. Using a dynamic programming approach, we show efficient
  PAC learnability when the number of negative examples is small. We also present
  an efficient learner which is consistent with all the positive examples and at least
  (1-1/e) fraction of the negative examples. This algorithm is based on maximizing
  a submodular function under matroid constraints. By performing experiments on both
  synthetic and real-world networks, we study how the network structure and sample
  complexity influence the quality of the inferred system.
