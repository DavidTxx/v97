abstract: This paper studies semi-supervised object classification in relational data,
  which is a fundamental problem in relational data modeling. The problem has been
  extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational learning (e.g.
  relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g. graph convolutional
  networks). Statistical relational learning methods can effectively model the dependency
  of object labels through conditional random fields for collective classification,
  whereas graph neural networks learn effective object representations for classification
  through end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network
  (GMNN) that combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution
  of object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained
  with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network learns
  effective object representations for approximating the posterior distributions of
  object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is used to model the
  local label dependency. Experiments on object classification, link classification,
  and unsupervised node representation learning show that GMNN achieves state-of-the-art
  results.
