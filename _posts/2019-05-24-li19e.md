abstract: 'Existing attention mechanisms are trained to attend to individual items
  in a collection (the memory) with a predefined, fixed granularity, e.g., a word
  token or an image grid. We propose area attention: a way to attend to areas in the
  memory, where each area contains a group of items that are structurally adjacent,
  e.g., spatially for a 2D memory such as images, or temporally for a 1D memory such
  as natural language sentences. Importantly, the shape and the size of an area are
  dynamically determined via learning, which enables a model to attend to information
  with varying granularity. Area attention can easily work with existing model architectures
  such as multi-head attention for simultaneously attending to multiple areas in the
  memory. We evaluate area attention on two tasks: neural machine translation (both
  character and token-level) and image captioning, and improve upon strong (state-of-the-art)
  baselines in all the cases. These improvements are obtainable with a basic form
  of area attention that is parameter free.'
