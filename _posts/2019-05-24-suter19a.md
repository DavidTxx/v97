abstract: The ability to learn disentangled representations that split underlying
  sources of variation in high dimensional, unstructured data is important for data
  efficient and robust use of neural networks. While various approaches aiming towards
  this goal have been proposed in recent times, a commonly accepted definition and
  validation procedure is missing. We provide a causal perspective on representation
  learning which covers disentanglement and domain shift robustness as special cases.
  Our causal framework allows us to introduce a new metric for the quantitative evaluation
  of deep latent variable models. We show how this metric can be estimated from labeled
  observational data and further provide an efficient estimation algorithm that scales
  linearly in the dataset size.
