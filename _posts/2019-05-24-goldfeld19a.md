abstract: We study the estimation of the mutual information I(X;T_$\ell$) between
  the input X to a deep neural network (DNN) and the output vector T_$\ell$ of its
  $\ell$-th hidden layer (an “internal representation”). Focusing on feedforward networks
  with fixed weights and noisy internal representations, we develop a rigorous framework
  for accurate estimation of I(X;T_$\ell$). By relating I(X;T_$\ell$) to information
  transmission over additive white Gaussian noise channels, we reveal that compression,
  i.e. reduction in I(X;T_$\ell$) over the course of training, is driven by progressive
  geometric clustering of the representations of samples from the same class. Experimental
  results verify this connection. Finally, we shift focus to purely deterministic
  DNNs, where I(X;T_$\ell$) is provably vacuous, and show that nevertheless, these
  models also cluster inputs belonging to the same class. The binning-based approximation
  of I(X;T_$\ell$) employed in past works to measure compression is identified as
  a measure of clustering, thus clarifying that these experiments were in fact tracking
  the same clustering phenomenon. Leveraging the clustering perspective, we provide
  new evidence that compression and generalization may not be causally related and
  discuss potential future research ideas.
