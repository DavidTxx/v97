abstract: Adversarial loss in a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is
  not designed to directly optimize evaluation metrics of a target task, and thus,
  may not always guide the generator in a GAN to generate data with improved metric
  scores. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel MetricGAN approach with an aim
  to optimize the generator with respect to one or multiple evaluation metrics. Moreover,
  based on MetricGAN, the metric scores of the generated data can also be arbitrarily
  specified by users. We tested the proposed MetricGAN on a speech enhancement task,
  which is particularly suitable to verify the proposed approach because there are
  multiple metrics measuring different aspects of speech signals. Moreover, these
  metrics are generally complex and could not be fully optimized by Lp or conventional
  adversarial losses.
