abstract: Low precision operations can provide scalability, memory savings, portability,
  and energy efficiency. This paper proposes SWALP, an approach to low precision training
  that averages low-precision SGD iterates with a modified learning rate schedule.
  SWALP is easy to implement and can match the performance of full-precision SGD even
  with all numbers quantized down to 8 bits, including the gradient accumulators.
  Additionally, we show that SWALP converges arbitrarily close to the optimal solution
  for quadratic objectives, and to a noise ball asymptotically smaller than low precision
  SGD in strongly convex settings.
