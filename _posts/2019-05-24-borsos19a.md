abstract: Adaptive importance sampling for stochastic optimization is a promising
  approach that offers improved convergence through variance reduction. In this work,
  we propose a new framework for variance reduction that enables the use of mixtures
  over predefined sampling distributions, which can naturally encode prior knowledge
  about the data. While these sampling distributions are fixed, the mixture weights
  are adapted during the optimization process. We propose VRM, a novel and efficient
  adaptive scheme that asymptotically recovers the best mixture weights in hindsight
  and can also accommodate sampling distributions over sets of points. We empirically
  demonstrate the versatility of VRM in a range of applications.
