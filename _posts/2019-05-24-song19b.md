abstract: Owing to the extremely high expressive power of deep neural networks, their
  side effect is to totally memorize training data even when the labels are extremely
  noisy. To overcome overfitting on the noisy labels, we propose a novel robust training
  method called SELFIE. Our key idea is to selectively refurbish and exploit unclean
  samples that can be corrected with high precision, thereby gradually increasing
  the number of available training samples. Taking advantage of this design, SELFIE
  effectively prevents the risk of noise accumulation from the false correction and
  fully exploits the training data. To validate the superiority of SELFIE, we conducted
  extensive experimentation using four real-world or synthetic data sets. The result
  showed that SELFIE remarkably improved absolute test error compared with two state-of-the-art
  methods.
