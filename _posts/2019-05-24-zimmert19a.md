abstract: We develop the first general semi-bandit algorithm that simultaneously achieves
  $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret for stochastic environments and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  regret for adversarial environments without knowledge of the regime or the number
  of rounds $T$. The leading problem-dependent constants of our bounds are not only
  optimal in some worst-case sense studied previously, but also optimal for two concrete
  instances of semi-bandit problems. Our algorithm and analysis extend the recent
  work of (Zimmert & Seldin, 2019) for the special case of multi-armed bandits, but
  importantly requires a novel hybrid regularizer designed specifically for semi-bandit.
  Experimental results on synthetic data show that our algorithm indeed performs well
  uniformly over different environments. We finally provide a preliminary extension
  of our results to the full bandit feedback.
