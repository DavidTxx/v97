abstract: Motivated by the rapid rise in statistical tools in <em>Functional Data
  Analysis</em>, we consider the Gaussian mechanism for achieving differential privacy
  (DP) with parameter estimates taking values in a, potentially infinite-dimensional,
  separable Banach space. Using classic results from probability theory, we show how
  densities over function spaces can be utilized to achieve the desired DP bounds.
  This extends prior results of Hall et al (2013) to a much broader class of statistical
  estimates and summaries, including “path level" summaries, nonlinear functionals,
  and full function releases. By focusing on Banach spaces, we provide a deeper picture
  of the challenges for privacy with complex data, especially the role regularization
  plays in balancing utility and privacy. Using an application to penalized smoothing,
  we highlight this balance in the context of mean function estimation. Simulations
  and an application to {diffusion tensor imaging} are briefly presented, with extensive
  additions included in a supplement.
