abstract: In binary classification, there are situations where negative (N) data are
  too diverse to be fully labeled and we often resort to positive-unlabeled (PU) learning
  in these scenarios. However, collecting a non-representative N set that contains
  only a small portion of all possible N data can often be much easier in practice.
  This paper studies a novel classification framework which incorporates such biased
  N (bN) data in PU learning. We provide a method based on empirical risk minimization
  to address this PUbN classification problem. Our approach can be regarded as a novel
  example-weighting algorithm, with the weight of each example computed through a
  preliminary step that draws inspiration from PU learning. We also derive an estimation
  error bound for the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our algorithm in not only PUbN learning scenarios but also ordinary PU learning
  scenarios on several benchmark datasets.
