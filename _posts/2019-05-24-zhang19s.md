abstract: We attempt to interpret how adversarially trained convolutional neural networks
  (AT-CNNs) recognize objects. We design systematic approaches to interpret AT-CNNs
  in both qualitative and quantitative ways and compare them with normally trained
  models. Surprisingly, we find that adversarial training alleviates the texture bias
  of standard CNNs when trained on object recognition tasks, and helps CNNs learn
  a more shape-biased representation. We validate our hypothesis from two aspects.
  First, we compare the salience maps of AT-CNNs and standard CNNs on clean images
  and images under different transformations. The comparison could visually show that
  the prediction of the two types of CNNs is sensitive to dramatically different types
  of features. Second, to achieve quantitative verification, we construct additional
  test datasets that destroy either textures or shapes, such as style-transferred
  version of clean data, saturated images and patch-shuffled ones, and then evaluate
  the classification accuracy of AT-CNNs and normal CNNs on these datasets. Our findings
  shed some light on why AT-CNNs are more robust than those normally trained ones
  and contribute to a better understanding of adversarial training over CNNs from
  an interpretation perspective.
