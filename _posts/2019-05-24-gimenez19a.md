abstract: 'The goal of feature selection is to identify important features that are
  relevant to explain a outcome variable. Most of the work in this domain has focused
  on identifying <em>globally</em> relevant features, which are features that are
  related to the outcome using evidence across the entire dataset. We study a more
  fine-grained statistical problem: <em>conditional feature selection</em>, where
  a feature may be relevant depending on the values of the other features. For example
  in genetic association studies, variant $A$ could be associated with the phenotype
  in the entire dataset, but conditioned on variant $B$ being present it might be
  independent of the phenotype. In this sense, variant $A$ is globally relevant, but
  conditioned on $B$ it is no longer locally relevant in that region of the feature
  space. We present a generalization of the knockoff procedure that performs <em>conditional
  feature selection</em> while controlling a generalization of the false discovery
  rate (FDR) to the conditional setting. By exploiting the feature/response model-free
  framework of the knockoffs, the quality of the statistical FDR guarantee is not
  degraded even when we perform conditional feature selections. We implement this
  method and present an algorithm that automatically partitions the feature space
  such that it enhances the differences between selected sets in different regions,
  and validate the statistical theoretical results with experiments.'
