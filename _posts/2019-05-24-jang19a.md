abstract: DBSCAN is a classical density-based clustering procedure with tremendous
  practical relevance. However, DBSCAN implicitly needs to compute the empirical density
  for each sample point, leading to a quadratic worst-case time complexity, which
  is too slow on large datasets. We propose DBSCAN++, a simple modification of DBSCAN
  which only requires computing the densities for a chosen subset of points. We show
  empirically that, compared to traditional DBSCAN, DBSCAN++ can provide not only
  competitive performance but also added robustness in the bandwidth hyperparameter
  while taking a fraction of the runtime. We also present statistical consistency
  guarantees showing the trade-off between computational cost and estimation rates.
  Surprisingly, up to a certain point, we can enjoy the same estimation rates while
  lowering computational cost, showing that DBSCAN++ is a sub-quadratic algorithm
  that attains minimax optimal rates for level-set estimation, a quality that may
  be of independent interest.
