abstract: 'Researchers have proposed a range of model compression techniques to reduce
  the computational and memory footprint of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work,
  we introduce Learned Intermediate representation Training (LIT), a novel model compression
  technique that outperforms a range of recent model compression techniques by leveraging
  the highly repetitive structure of modern DNNs (e.g., ResNet). LIT uses a teacher
  DNN to train a student DNN of reduced depth by leveraging two key ideas: 1) LIT
  directly compares intermediate representations of the teacher and student model
  and 2) LIT uses the intermediate representation from the teacher modelâ€™s previous
  block as input to the current student block during training, improving stability
  of intermediate representations in the student network. We show that LIT can substantially
  reduce network size without loss in accuracy on a range of DNN architectures and
  datasets. For example, LIT can compress ResNet on CIFAR10 by 3.4$\times$ outperforming
  network slimming and FitNets. Furthermore, LIT can compress, by depth, ResNeXt 5.5$\times$
  on CIFAR10 (image classification), VDCNN by 1.7$\times$ on Amazon Reviews (sentiment
  analysis), and StarGAN by 1.8$\times$ on CelebA (style transfer, i.e., GANs).'
