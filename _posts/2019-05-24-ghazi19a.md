abstract: We present a mechanism to compute a sketch (succinct summary) of how a complex
  modular deep network processes its inputs. The sketch summarizes essential information
  about the inputs and outputs of the network and can be used to quickly identify
  key components and summary statistics of the inputs. Furthermore, the sketch is
  recursive and can be unrolled to identify sub-components of these components and
  so forth, capturing a potentially complicated DAG structure. These sketches erase
  gracefully; even if we erase a fraction of the sketch at random, the remainder still
  retains the “high-weight” information present in the original sketch. The sketches
  can also be organized in a repository to implicitly form a “knowledge graph”; it
  is possible to quickly retrieve sketches in the repository that are related to a
  sketch of interest; arranged in this fashion, the sketches can also be used to learn
  emerging concepts by looking for new clusters in sketch space. Finally, in the scenario
  where we want to learn a ground truth deep network, we show that augmenting input/output
  pairs with these sketches can theoretically make it easier to do so.
