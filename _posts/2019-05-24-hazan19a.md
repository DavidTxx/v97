abstract: Suppose an agent is in a (possibly unknown) Markov Decision Process in the
  absence of a reward signal, what might we hope that an agent can efficiently learn
  to do? This work studies a broad class of objectives that are defined solely as
  functions of the state-visitation frequencies that are induced by how the agent
  behaves. For example, one natural, intrinsically defined, objective problem is for
  the agent to learn a policy which induces a distribution over state space that is
  as uniform as possible, which can be measured in an entropic sense. We provide an
  efficient algorithm to optimize such such intrinsically defined objectives, when
  given access to a black box planning oracle (which is robust to function approximation).
  Furthermore, when restricted to the tabular setting where we have sample based access
  to the MDP, our proposed algorithm is provably efficient, both in terms of its sample
  and computational complexities. Key to our algorithmic methodology is utilizing
  the conditional gradient method (a.k.a. the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) which utilizes
  an approximate MDP solver.
