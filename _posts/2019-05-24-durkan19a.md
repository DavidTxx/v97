abstract: Neural density estimators are flexible families of parametric models which
  have seen widespread use in unsupervised machine learning in recent years. Maximum-likelihood
  training typically dictates that these models be constrained to specify an explicit
  density. However, this limitation can be overcome by instead using a neural network
  to specify an energy function, or unnormalized density, which can subsequently be
  normalized to obtain a valid distribution. The challenge with this approach lies
  in accurately estimating the normalizing constant of the high-dimensional energy
  function. We propose the Autoregressive Energy Machine, an energy-based model which
  simultaneously learns an unnormalized density and computes an importance-sampling
  estimate of the normalizing constant for each conditional in an autoregressive decomposition.
  The Autoregressive Energy Machine achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite
  of density-estimation tasks.
