abstract: In standard classification problems, the assumption is that the entity making
  the decision (the <em>principal</em>) has access to <em>all</em> the samples. However,
  in many contexts, she either does not have direct access to the samples, or can
  inspect only a limited set of samples and does not know which are the most relevant
  ones. In such cases, she must rely on another party (the <em>agent</em>) to either
  provide the samples or point out the most relevant ones. If the agent has a different
  objective, then the principal cannot trust the submitted samples to be representative.
  She must set a <em>policy</em> for how she makes decisions, keeping in mind the
  agentâ€™s incentives. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for this
  problem and provide key structural and computational results.
