abstract: We study the problem of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with (smooth)
  non-convex loss functions under the differential-privacy (DP) model. Existing approaches
  for this problem mainly adopt gradient norms to measure the error, which in general
  cannot guarantee the quality of the solution. To address this issue, we first study
  the expected excess empirical (or population) risk, which was primarily used as
  the utility to measure the quality for convex loss functions. Specifically, we show
  that the excess empirical (or population) risk can be upper bounded by $\tilde{O}(\frac{d\log
  (1/\delta)}{\log n\epsilon^2})$ in the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP settings, where $n$
  is the data size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the space. The $\frac{1}{\log
  n}$ term in the empirical risk bound can be further improved to $\frac{1}{n^{\Omega(1)}}$
  (when $d$ is a constant) by a highly non-trivial analysis on the time-average error.
  To obtain more efficient solutions, we also consider the connection between achieving
  differential privacy and finding approximate local minimum. Particularly, we show
  that when the size $n$ is large enough, there are $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms
  which can find an approximate local minimum of the empirical risk with high probability
  in both the constrained and non-constrained settings. These results indicate that
  one can escape saddle points privately.
