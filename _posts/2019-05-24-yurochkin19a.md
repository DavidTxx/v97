abstract: In federated learning problems, data is scattered across different servers
  and exchanging or pooling it is often impractical or prohibited. We develop a Bayesian
  nonparametric framework for federated learning with neural networks. Each data server
  is assumed to provide local neural network weights, which are modeled through our
  framework. We then develop an inference approach that allows us to synthesize a
  more expressive global network without additional supervision, data pooling and
  with as few as a single communication round. We then demonstrate the efficacy of
  our approach on federated learning problems simulated from two popular image classification
  datasets.
