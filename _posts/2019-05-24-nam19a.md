abstract: 'A key problem in multi-label classification is to utilize dependencies
  among the labels. Chaining classifiers are a simple technique for addressing this
  problem but current algorithms all assume a fixed, static label ordering. In this
  work, we propose a multi-label classification approach which allows to choose a
  dynamic, context-dependent label ordering. Our proposed approach consists of two
  sub-components: a simple EM-like algorithm which bootstraps the learned model, and
  a more elaborate approach based on reinforcement learning. Our experiments on three
  public multi-label classification benchmarks show that our proposed dynamic label
  ordering approach based on reinforcement learning outperforms recurrent neural networks
  with fixed label ordering across both bipartition and ranking measures on all the
  three datasets. As a result, we obtain a powerful sequence prediction-based algorithm
  for multi-label classification, which is able to efficiently and explicitly exploit
  label dependencies.'
