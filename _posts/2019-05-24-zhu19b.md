abstract: Graph sparsification has been used to improve the computational cost of
  learning over graphs, e.g., Laplacian-regularized estimation and graph semi-supervised
  learning (SSL). However, when graphs vary over time, repeated sparsification requires
  polynomial order computational cost per update. We propose a new type of graph sparsification
  namely fault-tolerant (FT) sparsification to significantly reduce the cost to only
  a constant. Then the computational cost of subsequent graph learning tasks can be
  significantly improved with limited loss in their accuracy. In particular, we give
  theoretical analyze to upper bound the loss in the accuracy of the subsequent Laplacian-regularized
  estimation and graph SSL, due to the FT sparsification. In addition, FT spectral
  sparsification can be generalized to FT cut sparsification, for cut-based graph
  learning. Extensive experiments have confirmed the computational efficiencies and
  accuracies of the proposed methods for learning on dynamic graphs.
