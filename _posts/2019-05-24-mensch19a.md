abstract: 'Building upon recent advances in entropy-regularized optimal transport,
  and upon Fenchel duality between measures and continuous functions, we propose a
  generalization of the logistic loss that incorporates a metric or cost between classes.
  Unlike previous attempts to use optimal transport distances for learning, our loss
  results in unconstrained convex objective functions, supports infinite (or very
  large) class spaces, and naturally defines a geometric generalization of the softmax
  operator. The geometric properties of this loss make it suitable for predicting
  sparse and singular distributions, for instance supported on curves or hyper-surfaces.
  We study the theoretical properties of our loss and showcase its effectiveness on
  two applications: ordinal regression and drawing generation.'
