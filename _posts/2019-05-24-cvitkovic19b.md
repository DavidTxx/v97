abstract: Machine learning models that take computer program source code as input
  typically use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. However, a major challenge
  is that code is written using an open, rapidly changing vocabulary due to, e.g.,
  the coinage of new variable and method names. Reasoning over such a vocabulary is
  not something for which most NLP methods are designed. We introduce a Graph-Structured
  Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the
  model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code.
  We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based
  models for supervised learning on code improves the models’ performance on a code
  completion task and a variable naming task — with over 100% relative improvement
  on the latter — at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time.
