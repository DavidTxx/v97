abstract: Triangular map is a recent construct in probability theory that allows one
  to transform any source probability density function to any target density function.
  Based on triangular maps, we propose a general framework for high-dimensional density
  estimation, by specifying one-dimensional transformations (equivalently conditional
  densities) and appropriate conditioner networks. This framework (a) reveals the
  commonalities and differences of existing autoregressive and flow based methods,
  (b) allows a unified understanding of the limitations and representation power of
  these recent approaches and, (c) motivates us to uncover a new Sum-of-Squares (SOS)
  flow that is interpretable, universal, and easy to train. We perform several synthetic
  experiments on various density geometries to demonstrate the benefits (and short-comings)
  of such transformations. SOS flows achieve competitive results in simulations and
  several real-world datasets.
