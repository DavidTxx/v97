abstract: Stochastic differential equations are an important modeling class in many
  disciplines. Consequently, there exist many methods relying on various discretization
  and numerical integration schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel, probabilistic
  model for estimating the drift and diffusion given noisy observations of the underlying
  stochastic system. Using state-of-the-art adversarial and moment matching inference
  techniques, we avoid the discretization schemes of classical approaches. This leads
  to significant improvements in parameter accuracy and robustness given random initial
  guesses. On four established benchmark systems, we compare the performance of our
  algorithms to state-of-the-art solutions based on extended Kalman filtering and
  Gaussian processes.
