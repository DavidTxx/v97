abstract: Many applications involving visual and language understanding can be effectively
  solved using deep neural networks. Even though these techniques achieve state-of-the-art
  results, it is very challenging to apply them on devices with limited memory and
  computational capacity such as mobile phones, smart watches and IoT. We propose
  a neural projection approach for training compact on-device neural networks. We
  introduce "projection" networks that use locality-sensitive projections to generate
  compact binary representations and learn small neural networks with computationally
  efficient operations. We design a joint optimization framework where the projection
  network can be trained from scratch or leverage existing larger neural networks
  such as feed-forward NNs, CNNs or RNNs. The trained neural projection network can
  be directly used for inference on device at low memory and computation cost. We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of this as a general-purpose approach for significantly
  shrinking memory requirements of different types of neural networks while preserving
  good accuracy on multiple visual and text classification tasks.
