abstract: We investigate how the final parameters found by stochastic gradient descent
  are influenced by over-parameterization. We generate families of models by increasing
  the number of channels in a base network, and then perform a large hyper-parameter
  search to study how the test error depends on learning rate, batch size, and network
  width. We find that the optimal SGD hyper-parameters are determined by a "normalized
  noise scale," which is a function of the batch size, learning rate, and initialization
  conditions. In the absence of batch normalization, the optimal normalized noise
  scale is directly proportional to width. Wider networks, with their higher optimal
  noise scale, also achieve higher test accuracy. These observations hold for MLPs,
  ConvNets, and ResNets, and for two different parameterization schemes ("Standard"
  and "NTK"). We observe a similar trend with batch normalization for ResNets. Surprisingly,
  since the largest stable learning rate is bounded, the largest batch size consistent
  with the optimal normalized noise scale decreases as the width increases.
