abstract: The aim of this work is to enable inference of deep networks that retain
  high accuracy for the least possible model complexity, with the latter deduced from
  the data during inference. To this end, we revisit deep networks that comprise competing
  linear units, as opposed to nonlinear units that do not entail any form of (local)
  competition. In this context, our main technical innovation consists in an inferential
  setup that leverages solid arguments from Bayesian nonparametrics. We infer both
  the needed set of connections or locally competing sets of units, as well as the
  required floating-point precision for storing the network parameters. Specifically,
  we introduce auxiliary discrete latent variables representing which initial network
  components are actually needed for modeling the data at hand, and perform Bayesian
  inference over them by imposing appropriate stick-breaking priors. As we experimentally
  show using benchmark datasets, our approach yields networks with less computational
  footprint than the state-of-the-art, and with no compromises in predictive accuracy.
