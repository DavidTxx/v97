abstract: Understanding the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the context
  of deep neural networks has raised lots of concerns recently. Along this line, we
  study a general form of gradient based optimization dynamics with unbiased noise,
  which unifies SGD and standard Langevin dynamics. Through investigating this general
  optimization dynamics, we analyze the behavior of SGD on escaping from minima and
  its regularization effects. A novel indicator is derived to characterize the efficiency
  of escaping from minima through measuring the alignment of noise covariance and
  the curvature of loss function. Based on this indicator, two conditions are established
  to show which type of noise structure is superior to isotropic noise in term of
  escaping efficiency. We further show that the anisotropic noise in SGD satisfies
  the two conditions, and thus helps to escape from sharp and poor minima effectively,
  towards more stable and flat minima that typically generalize well. We systematically
  design various experiments to verify the benefits of the anisotropic noise, compared
  with full gradient descent plus isotropic diffusion (i.e. Langevin dynamics).
