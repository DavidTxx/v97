abstract: Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is the leading algorithm for solving
  large imperfect-information games. It converges to an equilibrium by iteratively
  traversing the game tree. In order to deal with extremely large games, abstraction
  is typically applied before running CFR. The abstracted game is solved with tabular
  CFR, and its solution is mapped back to the full game. This process can be problematic
  because aspects of abstraction are often manual and domain specific, abstraction
  algorithms may miss important strategic nuances of the game, and there is a chicken-and-egg
  problem because determining a good abstraction requires knowledge of the equilibrium
  of the game. This paper introduces <em>Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization</em>,
  a form of CFR that obviates the need for abstraction by instead using deep neural
  networks to approximate the behavior of CFR in the full game. We show that Deep
  CFR is principled and achieves strong performance in large poker games. This is
  the first non-tabular variant of CFR to be successful in large games.
