abstract: This paper considers generalized linear models using rule-based features,
  also referred to as rule ensembles, for regression and probabilistic classification.
  Rules facilitate model interpretation while also capturing nonlinear dependences
  and interactions. Our problem formulation accordingly trades off rule set complexity
  and prediction accuracy. Column generation is used to optimize over an exponentially
  large space of rules without pre-generating a large subset of candidates or greedily
  boosting rules one by one. The column generation subproblem is solved using either
  integer programming or a heuristic optimizing the same objective. In experiments
  involving logistic and linear regression, the proposed methods obtain better accuracy-complexity
  trade-offs than existing rule ensemble algorithms. At one end of the trade-off,
  the methods are competitive with less interpretable benchmark models.
