abstract: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is arguably
  the most common metric in machine learning for assessing the quality of a two-class
  classification model. As the number and complexity of machine learning applications
  grows, so too does the need for measures that can gracefully extend to classification
  models trained for more than two classes. Prior work in this area has proven computationally
  intractable and/or inconsistent with known properties of AUC, and thus there is
  still a need for an improved multi-class efficacy metric. We provide in this work
  a multi-class extension of AUC that we call AUC{\textmu} that is derived from first
  principles of the binary class AUC. AUC{\textmu} has similar computational complexity
  to AUC and maintains the properties of AUC critical to its interpretation and use.
