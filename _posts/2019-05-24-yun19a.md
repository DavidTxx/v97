abstract: 'We study high-dimensional estimators with the trimmed $\ell_1$ penalty,
  which leaves the h largest parameter entries penalty-free. While optimization techniques
  for this nonconvex penalty have been studied, the statistical properties have not
  yet been analyzed. We present the first statistical analyses for M-estimation, and
  characterize support recovery, $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ error of the trimmed $\ell_1$
  estimates as a function of the trimming parameter h. Our results show different
  regimes based on how h compares to the true support size. Our second contribution
  is a new algorithm for the trimmed regularization problem, which has the same theoretical
  convergence rate as difference of convex (DC) algorithms, but in practice is faster
  and finds lower objective values. Empirical evaluation of $\ell_1$ trimming for
  sparse linear regression and graphical model estimation indicate that trimmed $\ell_1$
  can outperform vanilla $\ell_1$ and non-convex alternatives. Our last contribution
  is to show that the trimmed penalty is beneficial beyond M-estimation, and yields
  promising results for two deep learning tasks: input structures recovery and network
  sparsification.'
