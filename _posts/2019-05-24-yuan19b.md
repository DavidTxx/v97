abstract: We present a deep generative model which explicitly models object occlusions
  for compositional scene representation. Latent representations of objects are disentangled
  into location, size, shape, and appearance, and the visual scene can be generated
  compositionally by integrating these representations and an infinite-dimensional
  binary vector indicating presences of objects in the scene. By training the model
  to learn spatial dependences of pixels in the unsupervised setting, the number of
  objects, pixel-level segregation of objects, and presences of objects in overlapping
  regions can be estimated through inference of latent variables. Extensive experiments
  conducted on a series of specially designed datasets demonstrate that the proposed
  method outperforms two state-of-the-art methods when object occlusions exist.
