abstract: Music score is often handled as one-dimensional sequential data. Unlike
  words in a text document, notes in music score can be played simultaneously by the
  polyphonic nature and each of them has its own duration. In this paper, we represent
  the unique form of musical score using graph neural network and apply it for rendering
  expressive piano performance from the music score. Specifically, we design the model
  using note-level gated graph neural network and measure-level hierarchical attention
  network with bidirectional long short-term memory with an iterative feedback method.
  In addition, to model different styles of performance for a given input score, we
  employ a variational auto-encoder. The result of the listening test shows that our
  proposed model generated more human-like performances compared to a baseline model
  and a hierarchical attention network model that handles music score as a word-like
  sequence.
