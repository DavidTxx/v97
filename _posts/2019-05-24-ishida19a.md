abstract: In contrast to the standard classification paradigm where the true class
  is given to each training pattern, complementary-label learning only uses training
  patterns each equipped with a complementary label, which only specifies one of the
  classes that the pattern does not belong to. The goal of this paper is to derive
  a novel framework of complementary-label learning with an unbiased estimator of
  the classification risk, for arbitrary losses and modelsâ€”all existing methods have
  failed to achieve this goal. Not only is this beneficial for the learning stage,
  it also makes model/hyper-parameter selection (through cross-validation) possible
  without the need of any ordinarily labeled validation data, while using any linear/non-linear
  models or convex/non-convex loss functions. We further improve the risk estimator
  by a non-negative correction and gradient ascent trick, and demonstrate its superiority
  through experiments.
