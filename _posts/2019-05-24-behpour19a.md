abstract: 'Active learning methods, like uncertainty sampling, combined with probabilistic
  prediction techniques have achieved success in various problems like image classification
  and text classification. For more complex multivariate prediction tasks, the relationships
  between labels play an important role in designing structured classifiers with better
  performance. However, computational time complexity limits prevalent probabilistic
  methods from effectively supporting active learning. Specifically, while non-probabilistic
  methods based on structured support vector ma-chines can be tractably applied to
  predicting cuts and bipartite matchings, conditional random fields are intractable
  for these structures. We propose an adversarial approach for active learning with
  structured prediction domains that is tractable for cuts and matching. We evaluate
  this approach algorithmically in two important structured prediction problems: multi-label
  classification and object tracking in videos. We demonstrate better accuracy and
  computational efficiency for our proposed method.'
