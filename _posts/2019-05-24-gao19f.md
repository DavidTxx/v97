abstract: We propose a novel formulation for phase synchronization—the statistical
  problem of jointly estimating alignment angles from noisy pairwise comparisons—as
  a nonconvex optimization problem that enforces consistency among the pairwise comparisons
  in multiple frequency channels. Inspired by harmonic retrieval in signal processing,
  we develop a simple yet efficient two-stage algorithm that leverages the multi-frequency
  information. We demonstrate in theory and practice that the proposed algorithm significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art phase synchronization algorithms, at a mild computational
  costs incurred by using the extra frequency channels. We also extend our algorithmic
  framework to general synchronization problems over compact Lie groups.
