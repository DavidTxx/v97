abstract: A wide class of machine learning algorithms can be reduced to variable elimination
  on factor graphs. While factor graphs provide a unifying notation for these algorithms,
  they do not provide a compact way to express repeated structure when compared to
  plate diagrams for directed graphical models. To exploit efficient tensor algebra
  in graphs with plates of variables, we generalize undirected factor graphs to plated
  factor graphs and variable elimination to a tensor variable elimination algorithm
  that operates directly on plated factor graphs. Moreover, we generalize complexity
  bounds based on treewidth and characterize the class of plated factor graphs for
  which inference is tractable. As an application, we integrate tensor variable elimination
  into the Pyro probabilistic programming language to enable exact inference in discrete
  latent variable models with repeated structure. We validate our methods with experiments
  on both directed and undirected graphical models, including applications to polyphonic
  music modeling, animal movement modeling, and latent sentiment analysis.
