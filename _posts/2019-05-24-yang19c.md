abstract: This paper aims to build efficient convolutional neural networks using a
  set of Lego filters. Many successful building blocks, e.g., inception and residual
  modules, have been designed to refresh state-of-the-art records of CNNs on visual
  recognition tasks. Beyond these high-level modules, we suggest that an ordinary
  filter in the neural network can be upgraded to a sophisticated module as well.
  Filter modules are established by assembling a shared set of Lego filters that are
  often of much lower dimensions. Weights in Lego filters and binary masks to stack
  Lego filters for these filter modules can be simultaneously optimized in an end-to-end
  manner as usual. Inspired by network engineering, we develop a split-transform-merge
  strategy for an efficient convolution by exploiting intermediate Lego feature maps.
  The compression and acceleration achieved by Lego Networks using the proposed Lego
  filters have been theoretically discussed. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
  and deep models demonstrate the advantages of the proposed Lego filters and their
  potential real-world applications on mobile devices.
