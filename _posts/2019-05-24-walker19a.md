abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric method to learn translation-invariant
  relationships on non-Euclidean domains. The resulting graph convolutional Gaussian
  processes can be applied to problems in machine learning for which the input observations
  are functions with domains on general graphs. The structure of these models allows
  for high dimensional inputs while retaining expressibility, as is the case with
  convolutional neural networks. We present applications of graph convolutional Gaussian
  processes to images and triangular meshes, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness,
  comparing favorably to existing methods, despite being relatively simple models.
