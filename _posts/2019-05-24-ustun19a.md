abstract: In domains such as medicine, it can be acceptable for machine learning models
  to include <em>sensitive attributes</em> such as gender and ethnicity. In this work,
  we argue that when there is this kind of treatment disparity, then it should be
  in the best interest of each group. Drawing on ethical principles such as beneficence
  ("do the best") and non-maleficence ("do no harm"), we show how to use sensitive
  attributes to train decoupled classifiers that satisfy preference guarantees. These
  guarantees ensure the majority of individuals in each group prefer their assigned
  classifier to (i) a pooled model that ignores group membership (rationality), and
  (ii) the model assigned to any other group (envy-freeness). We introduce a recursive
  procedure that adaptively selects group attributes for decoupling, and present formal
  conditions to ensure preference guarantees in terms of generalization error. We
  validate the effectiveness of the procedure on real-world datasets, showing that
  it improves accuracy without violating preference guarantees on test data.
