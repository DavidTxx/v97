abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental procedures
  in exploratory data analysis and is the basic step in applications ranging from
  quantitative finance and bioinformatics to image analysis and neuroscience. However,
  it is well-documented that the applicability of PCA in many real scenarios could
  be constrained by an "immune deficiency" to outliers such as corrupted observations.
  We consider the following algorithmic question about the PCA with outliers. For
  a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, how to learn a subset of points, say 1%
  of the total number of points, such that the remaining part of the points is best
  fit into some unknown $r$-dimensional subspace? We provide a rigorous algorithmic
  analysis of the problem. We show that the problem is solvable in time $n^{O(d^2)}$.
  In particular, for constant dimension the problem is solvable in polynomial time.
  We complement the algorithmic result by the lower bound, showing that unless Exponential
  Time Hypothesis fails, in time $f(d)n^{o(d)}$, for any function $f$ of $d$, it is
  impossible not only to solve the problem exactly but even to approximate it within
  a constant factor.
