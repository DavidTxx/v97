abstract: The well-known Gumbel-Max trick for sampling from a categorical distribution
  can be extended to sample $k$ elements without replacement. We show how to implicitly
  apply this ’Gumbel-Top-$k$’ trick on a factorized distribution over sequences, allowing
  to draw exact samples without replacement using a Stochastic Beam Search. Even for
  exponentially large domains, the number of model evaluations grows only linear in
  $k$ and the maximum sampled sequence length. The algorithm creates a theoretical
  connection between sampling and (deterministic) beam search and can be used as a
  principled intermediate alternative. In a translation task, the proposed method
  compares favourably against alternatives to obtain diverse yet good quality translations.
  We show that sequences sampled without replacement can be used to construct low-variance
  estimators for expected sentence-level BLEU score and model entropy.
