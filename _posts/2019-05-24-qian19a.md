abstract: We study the problem of minimizing the average of a very large number of
  smooth functions, which is of key importance in training supervised learning models.
  One of the most celebrated methods in this context is the SAGA algorithm of Defazio
  et al. (2014). Despite years of research on the topic, a general-purpose version
  of SAGA—one that would include arbitrary importance sampling and minibatching schemes—does
  not exist. We remedy this situation and propose a general and flexible variant of
  SAGA following the arbitrary sampling paradigm. We perform an iteration complexity
  analysis of the method, largely possible due to the construction of new stochastic
  Lyapunov functions. We establish linear convergence rates in the smooth and strongly
  convex regime, and under certain error bound conditions also in a regime without
  strong convexity. Our rates match those of the primal-dual method Quartz (Qu et
  al., 2015) for which an arbitrary sampling analysis is available, which makes a
  significant step towards closing the gap in our understanding of complexity of primal
  and dual methods for finite sum problems. Finally, we show through experiments that
  specific variants of our general SAGA method can perform better in practice than
  other competing methods.
