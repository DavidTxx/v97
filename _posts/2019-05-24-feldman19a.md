abstract: Excessive reuse of holdout data can lead to overfitting. However, there
  is little concrete evidence of significant overfitting due to holdout reuse in popular
  multiclass benchmarks today. Known results show that, in the worst-case, revealing
  the accuracy of $k$ adaptively chosen classifiers on a data set of size $n$ allows
  to create a classifier with bias of $\Theta(\sqrt{k/n})$ for any binary prediction
  problem. We show a new upper bound of $\tilde O(\max\{\sqrt{k\log(n)/(mn)}, k/n\})$
  on the worst-case bias that any attack can achieve in a prediction problem with
  $m$ classes. Moreover, we present an efficient attack that achieve a bias of $\Omega(\sqrt{k/(m^2
  n)})$ and improves on previous work for the binary setting ($m=2$). We also present
  an inefficient attack that achieves a bias of $\tilde\Omega(k/n)$. Complementing
  our theoretical work, we give new practical attacks to stress-test multiclass benchmarks
  by aiming to create as large a bias as possible with a given number of queries.
  Our experiments show that the additional uncertainty of prediction with a large
  number of classes indeed mitigates the effect of our best attacks.
