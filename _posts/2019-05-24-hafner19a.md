abstract: Planning has been very successful for control tasks with known environment
  dynamics. To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn
  the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models
  that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially
  in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely
  model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions
  through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics
  model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach
  this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition
  components. Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that
  we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous
  control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards,
  which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with
  learned models. PlaNet uses substantially fewer episodes and reaches final performance
  close to and sometimes higher than strong model-free algorithms.
