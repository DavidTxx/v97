abstract: Diversification has been shown to be a powerful mechanism for learning robust
  models in non-convex settings. A notable example is learning mixture models, in
  which enforcing diversity between the different mixture components allows us to
  prevent the model collapsing phenomenon and capture more patterns from the observed
  data. In this work, we present a variational approach for diversity-promoting learning,
  which leverages the entropy functional as a natural mechanism for enforcing diversity.
  We develop a simple and efficient functional gradient-based algorithm for optimizing
  the variational objective function, which provides a significant generalization
  of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). We test our method on various challenging
  real world problems, including deep embedded clustering and deep anomaly detection.
  Empirical results show that our method provides an effective mechanism for diversity-promoting
  learning, achieving substantial improvement over existing methods.
