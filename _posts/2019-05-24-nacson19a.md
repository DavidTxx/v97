abstract: With an eye toward understanding complexity control in deep learning, we
  study how infinitesimal regularization or gradient descent optimization lead to
  margin maximizing solutions in both homogeneous and non homogeneous models, extending
  previous work that focused on infinitesimal regularization only in homogeneous models.
  To this end we study the limit of loss minimization with a diverging norm constraint
  (the “constrained path”), relate it to the limit of a “margin path” and characterize
  the resulting solution. For non-homogeneous ensemble models, which output is a sum
  of homogeneous sub-models, we show that this solution discards the shallowest sub-models
  if they are unnecessary. For homogeneous models, we show convergence to a “lexicographic
  max-margin solution”, and provide conditions under which max-margin solutions are
  also attained as the limit of unconstrained gradient descent.
