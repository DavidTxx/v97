abstract: Existing popular methods for semi-supervised learning with Graph Neural
  Networks (such as the Graph Convolutional Network) provably cannot learn a general
  class of neighborhood mixing relationships. To address this weakness, we propose
  a new model, MixHop, that can learn these relationships, including difference operators,
  by repeatedly mixing feature representations of neighbors at various distances.
  MixHop requires no additional memory or computational complexity, and outperforms
  on challenging baselines. In addition, we propose sparsity regularization that allows
  us to visualize how the network prioritizes neighborhood information across different
  graph datasets. Our analysis of the learned architectures reveals that neighborhood
  mixing varies per datasets.
