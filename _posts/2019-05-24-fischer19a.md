abstract: We present DL2, a system for training and querying neural networks with
  logical constraints. Using DL2, one can declaratively specify domain knowledge constraints
  to be enforced during training, as well as pose queries on the model to find inputs
  that satisfy a set of constraints. DL2 works by translating logical constraints
  into a loss function with desirable mathematical properties. The loss is then minimized
  with standard gradient-based methods. We evaluate DL2 by training networks with
  interesting constraints in unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised settings.
  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DL2 is more expressive than prior
  approaches combining logic and neural networks, and its loss functions are better
  suited for optimization. Further, we show that for a number of queries, DL2 can
  find the desired inputs in seconds (even for large models such as ResNet-50 on ImageNet).
