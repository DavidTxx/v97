abstract: A critical flaw of existing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods
  is their inability to significantly outperform the demonstrator. This is because
  IRL typically seeks a reward function that makes the demonstrator appear near-optimal,
  rather than inferring the underlying intentions of the demonstrator that may have
  been poorly executed in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel reward-learning-from-observation
  algorithm, Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation (T-REX), that extrapolates beyond
  a set of (approximately) ranked demonstrations in order to infer high-quality reward
  functions from a set of potentially poor demonstrations. When combined with deep
  reinforcement learning, T-REX outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and
  IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks and achieves performance
  that is often more than twice the performance of the best demonstration. We also
  demonstrate that T-REX is robust to ranking noise and can accurately extrapolate
  intention by simply watching a learner noisily improve at a task over time.
