abstract: Recent studies on diffusion-based sampling methods have shown that Langevin
  Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms can be beneficial for non-convex optimization, and
  rigorous theoretical guarantees have been proven for both asymptotic and finite-time
  regimes. Algorithmically, LMC-based algorithms resemble the well-known gradient
  descent (GD) algorithm, where the GD recursion is perturbed by an additive Gaussian
  noise whose variance has a particular form. Fractional Langevin Monte Carlo (FLMC)
  is a recently proposed extension of LMC, where the Gaussian noise is replaced by
  a heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable noise. As opposed to its Gaussian counterpart, these
  heavy-tailed perturbations can incur large jumps and it has been empirically demonstrated
  that the choice of $\alpha$-stable noise can provide several advantages in modern
  machine learning problems, both in optimization and sampling contexts. However,
  as opposed to LMC, only asymptotic convergence properties of FLMC have been yet
  established. In this study, we analyze the non-asymptotic behavior of FLMC for non-convex
  optimization and prove finite-time bounds for its expected suboptimality. Our results
  show that the weak-error of FLMC increases faster than LMC, which suggests using
  smaller step-sizes in FLMC. We finally extend our results to the case where the
  exact gradients are replaced by stochastic gradients and show that similar results
  hold in this setting as well.
