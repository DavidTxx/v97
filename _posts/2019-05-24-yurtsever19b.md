abstract: We propose a class of variance-reduced stochastic conditional gradient methods.
  By adopting the recent stochastic path-integrated differential estimator technique
  (SPIDER) of Fang et. al. (2018) for the classical Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, we introduce
  SPIDER-FW for finite-sum minimization as well as the more general expectation minimization
  problems. SPIDER-FW enjoys superior complexity guarantees in the non-convex setting,
  while matching the best known FW variants in the convex case. We also extend our
  framework a la conditional gradient sliding (CGS) of Lan & Zhou. (2016), and propose
  SPIDER-CGS.
