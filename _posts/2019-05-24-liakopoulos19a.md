abstract: We study a class of online convex optimization problems with long-term budget
  constraints that arise naturally as reliability guarantees or total consumption
  constraints. In this general setting, prior work by Mannor et al. (2009) has shown
  that achieving no regret is impossible if the functions defining the agent’s budget
  are chosen by an adversary. To overcome this obstacle, we refine the agent’s regret
  metric by introducing the notion of a "K-benchmark", i.e., a comparator which meets
  the problem’s allotted budget over any window of length K. The impossibility analysis
  of Mannor et al. (2009) is recovered when K=T; however, for K=o(T), we show that
  it is possible to minimize regret while still meeting the problem’s long-term budget
  constraints. We achieve this via an online learning policy based on Cautious Online
  Lagrangiant Descent (COLD) for which we derive explicit bounds, in terms of both
  the incurred regret and the residual budget violations.
