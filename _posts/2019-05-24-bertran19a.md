abstract: Data collection and sharing are pervasive aspects of modern society. This
  process can either be voluntary, as in the case of a person taking a facial image
  to unlock his/her phone, or incidental, such as traffic cameras collecting videos
  on pedestrians. An undesirable side effect of these processes is that shared data
  can carry information about attributes that users might consider as sensitive, even
  when such information is of limited use for the task. It is therefore desirable
  for both data collectors and users to design procedures that minimize sensitive
  information leakage. Balancing the competing objectives of providing meaningful
  individualized service levels and inference while obfuscating sensitive information
  is still an open problem. In this work, we take an information theoretic approach
  that is implemented as an unconstrained adversarial game between Deep Neural Networks
  in a principled, data-driven manner. This approach enables us to learn domain-preserving
  stochastic transformations that maintain performance on existing algorithms while
  minimizing sensitive information leakage.
