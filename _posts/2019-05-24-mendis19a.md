abstract: Predicting the number of clock cycles a processor takes to execute a block
  of assembly instructions in steady state (the throughput) is important for both
  compiler designers and performance engineers. Building an analytical model to do
  so is especially complicated in modern x86-64 Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
  machines with sophisticated processor microarchitectures in that it is tedious,
  error prone, and must be performed from scratch for each processor generation. In
  this paper we present Ithemal, the first tool which learns to predict the throughput
  of a set of instructions. Ithemal uses a hierarchical LSTM–based approach to predict
  throughput based on the opcodes and operands of instructions in a basic block. We
  show that Ithemal is more accurate than state-of-the-art hand-written tools currently
  used in compiler backends and static machine code analyzers. In particular, our
  model has less than half the error of state-of-the-art analytical models (LLVM’s
  llvm-mca and Intel’s IACA). Ithemal is also able to predict these throughput values
  just as fast as the aforementioned tools, and is easily ported across a variety
  of processor microarchitectures with minimal developer effort.
