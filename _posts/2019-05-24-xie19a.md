abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) naturally arises in many machine learning applications,
  yet the heavy computational burden limits its wide-spread uses. To address the scalability
  issue, we propose an implicit generative learning-based framework called SPOT (Scalable
  Push-forward of Optimal Transport). Specifically, we approximate the optimal transport
  plan by a pushforward of a reference distribution, and cast the optimal transport
  problem into a minimax problem. We then can solve OT problems efficiently using
  primal dual stochastic gradient-type algorithms. We also show that we can recover
  the density of the optimal transport plan using neural ordinary differential equations.
  Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate that SPOT is
  robust and has favorable convergence behavior. SPOT also allows us to efficiently
  sample from the optimal transport plan, which benefits downstream applications such
  as domain adaptation.
