abstract: We present differentially private efficient algorithms for learning union
  of polygons in the plane (which are not necessarily convex). Our algorithms achieve
  $(\alpha,\beta)$-PAC learning and $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy using
  a sample of size $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha\epsilon}k\log d\right)$, where
  the domain is $[d]\times[d]$ and $k$ is the number of edges in the union of polygons.
