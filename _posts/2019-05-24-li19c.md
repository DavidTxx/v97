abstract: In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning approach for few-shot classification,
  which learns transferable prior knowledge across tasks and directly produces network
  parameters for similar unseen tasks with training samples. Our approach, called
  LGM-Net, includes two key modules, namely, TargetNet and MetaNet. The TargetNet
  module is a neural network for solving a specific task and the MetaNet module aims
  at learning to generate functional weights for TargetNet by observing training samples.
  We also present an intertask normalization strategy for the training process to
  leverage common information shared across different tasks. The experimental results
  on Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets demonstrate that LGM-Net can effectively adapt
  to similar unseen tasks and achieve competitive performance, and the results on
  synthetic datasets show that transferable prior knowledge is learned by the MetaNet
  module via mapping training data to functional weights. LGM-Net enables fast learning
  and adaptation since no further tuning steps are required compared to other meta-learning
  approaches
