abstract: We develop an approach to learn an interpretable semi-parametric model of
  a latent continuous-time stochastic dynamical system, assuming noisy high-dimensional
  outputs sampled at uneven times. The dynamics are described by a nonlinear stochastic
  differential equation (SDE) driven by a Wiener process, with a drift evolution function
  drawn from a Gaussian process (GP) conditioned on a set of learnt fixed points and
  corresponding local Jacobian matrices. This form yields a flexible nonparametric
  model of the dynamics, with a representation corresponding directly to the interpretable
  portraits routinely employed in the study of nonlinear dynamical systems. The learning
  algorithm combines inference of continuous latent paths underlying observed data
  with a sparse variational description of the dynamical process. We demonstrate our
  approach on simulated data from different nonlinear dynamical systems.
