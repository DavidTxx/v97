abstract: Causal inference requires assumptions about the data generating process,
  many of which are unverifiable from the data. Given that some causal assumptions
  might be uncertain or disputed, formal methods are needed to quantify how sensitive
  research conclusions are to violations of those assumptions. Although an extensive
  literature exists on the topic, most results are limited to specific model structures,
  while a general-purpose algorithmic framework for sensitivity analysis is still
  lacking. In this paper, we develop a formal, systematic approach to sensitivity
  analysis for arbitrary linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs). We start by formalizing
  sensitivity analysis as a constrained identification problem. We then develop an
  efficient, graph-based identification algorithm that exploits non-zero constraints
  on both directed and bidirected edges. This allows researchers to systematically
  derive sensitivity curves for a target causal quantity with an arbitrary set of
  path coefficients and error covariances as sensitivity parameters. These results
  can be used to display the degree to which violations of causal assumptions affect
  the target quantity of interest, and to judge, on scientific grounds, whether problematic
  degrees of violations are plausible.
