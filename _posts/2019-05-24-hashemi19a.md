abstract: We study the problem of selecting most informative subset of a large observation
  set to enable accurate estimation of unknown parameters. This problem arises in
  a variety of settings in machine learning and signal processing including feature
  selection, phase retrieval, and target localization. Since for quadratic measurement
  models the moment matrix of the optimal estimator is generally unknown, majority
  of prior work resorts to approximation techniques such as linearization of the observation
  model to optimize the alphabetical optimality criteria of an approximate moment
  matrix. Conversely, by exploiting a connection to the classical Van Treesâ€™ inequality,
  we derive new alphabetical optimality criteria without distorting the relational
  structure of the observation model. We further show that under certain conditions
  on parameters of the problem these optimality criteria are monotone and (weak) submodular
  set functions. These results enable us to develop an efficient greedy observation
  selection algorithm uniquely tailored for quadratic models, and provide theoretical
  bounds on its achievable utility.
