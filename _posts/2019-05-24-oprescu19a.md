abstract: We propose the orthogonal random forest, an algorithm that combines Neyman-orthogonality
  to reduce sensitivity with respect to estimation error of nuisance parameters with
  generalized random forests (Athey et al., 2017)â€”a flexible non-parametric method
  for statistical estimation of conditional moment models using random forests. We
  provide a consistency rate and establish asymptotic normality for our estimator.
  We show that under mild assumptions on the consistency rate of the nuisance estimator,
  we can achieve the same error rate as an oracle with a priori knowledge of these
  nuisance parameters. We show that when the nuisance functions have a locally sparse
  parametrization, then a local ell_1-penalized regression achieves the required rate.
  We apply our method to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects from observational
  data with discrete treatments or continuous treatments, and we show that, unlike
  prior work, our method provably allows to control for a high-dimensional set of
  variables under standard sparsity conditions. We also provide a comprehensive empirical
  evaluation of our algorithm on both synthetic and real data.
