abstract: 'Crowdsourcing has emerged as a core component of data science pipelines.
  From collected noisy worker labels, aggregation models that incorporate worker reliability
  parameters aim to infer a latent true annotation. In this paper, we argue that existing
  crowdsourcing approaches do not sufficiently model worker correlations observed
  in practical settings; we propose in response an enhanced Bayesian classifier combination
  (EBCC) model, with inference based on a mean-field variational approach. An introduced
  mixture of intra-class reliabilities—connected to tensor decomposition and item
  clustering—induces inter-worker correlation. EBCC does not suffer the limitations
  of existing correlation models: intractable marginalisation of missing labels and
  poor scaling to large worker cohorts. Extensive empirical comparison on 17 real-world
  datasets sees EBCC achieving the highest mean accuracy across 10 benchmark crowdsourcing
  methods.'
