abstract: Bayesian methods for adaptive decision-making, such as Bayesian optimisation,
  active learning, and active search have seen great success in relevant applications.
  However, real world data collection tasks are more broad and complex, as we may
  need to achieve a combination of the above goals and/or application specific goals.
  In such scenarios, specialised methods have limited applicability. In this work,
  we design a new myopic strategy for a wide class of adaptive design of experiment
  (DOE) problems, where we wish to collect data in order to fulfil a given goal. Our
  approach, Myopic Posterior Sampling (MPS), which is inspired by the classical posterior
  sampling algorithm for multi-armed bandits, enables us to address a broad suite
  of DOE tasks where a practitioner may incorporate domain expertise about the system
  and specify her desired goal via a reward function. Empirically, this general-purpose
  strategy is competitive with more specialised methods in a wide array of synthetic
  and real world DOE tasks. More importantly, it enables addressing complex DOE goals
  where no existing method seems applicable. On the theoretical side, we leverage
  ideas from adaptive submodularity and reinforcement learning to derive conditions
  under which MPS achieves sublinear regret against natural benchmark policies.
