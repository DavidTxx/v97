abstract: We consider the problem of the optimization of bidding strategies in prior-dependent
  revenue-maximizing auctions, when the seller fixes the reserve prices based on the
  bid distributions. Our study is done in the setting where one bidder is strategic.
  Using a variational approach, we study the complexity of the original objective
  and we introduce a relaxation of the objective functional in order to use gradient
  descent methods. Our approach is simple, general and can be applied to various value
  distributions and revenue-maximizing mechanisms. The new strategies we derive yield
  massive uplifts compared to the traditional truthfully bidding strategy.
