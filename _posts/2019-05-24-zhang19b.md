abstract: We investigate the feasibility of learning from both fully-labeled supervised
  data and contextual bandit data. We specifically consider settings in which the
  underlying learning signal may be different between these two data sources. Theoretically,
  we state and prove no-regret algorithms for learning that is robust to divergences
  between the two sources. Empirically, we evaluate some of these algorithms on a
  large selection of datasets, showing that our approaches are feasible, and helpful
  in practice.
