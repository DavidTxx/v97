abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) has received considerable attention
  recently as a model for data synthesis, without an explicit specification of a likelihood
  function. There has been commensurate interest in leveraging likelihood estimates
  to improve GAN training. To enrich the understanding of this fast-growing yet almost
  exclusively heuristic-driven subject, we elucidate the theoretical roots of some
  of the empirical attempts to stabilize and improve GAN training with the introduction
  of likelihoods. We highlight new insights from variational theory of diffusion processes
  to derive a likelihood-based regularizing scheme for GAN training, and present a
  novel approach to train GANs with an unnormalized distribution instead of empirical
  samples. To substantiate our claims, we provide experimental evidence on how our
  theoretically-inspired new algorithms improve upon current practice.
