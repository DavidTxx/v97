abstract: We propose moment-based variational inference as a flexible framework for
  approximate smoothing of latent Markov jump processes. The main ingredient of our
  approach is to partition the set of all transitions of the latent process into classes.
  This allows to express the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the approximate to the
  posterior process in terms of a set of moment functions that arise naturally from
  the chosen partition. To illustrate possible choices of the partition, we consider
  special classes of jump processes that frequently occur in applications. We then
  extend the results to latent parameter inference and demonstrate the method on several
  examples.
