abstract: 'Recent empirical works have successfully used unlabeled data to learn feature
  representations that are broadly useful in downstream classification tasks. Several
  of these methods are reminiscent of the well-known word2vec embedding algorithm:
  leveraging availability of pairs of semantically “similar" data points and “negative
  samples," the learner forces the inner product of representations of similar pairs
  with each other to be higher on average than with negative samples. The current
  paper uses the term <em>contrastive learning</em> for such algorithms and presents
  a theoretical framework for analyzing them by introducing <em>latent classes</em>
  and hypothesizing that semantically similar points are sampled from the same latent
  class. This framework allows us to show provable guarantees on the performance of
  the learned representations on the average classification task that is comprised
  of a subset of the same set of latent classes. Our generalization bound also shows
  that learned representations can reduce (labeled) sample complexity on downstream
  tasks. We conduct controlled experiments in both the text and image domains to support
  the theory.'
