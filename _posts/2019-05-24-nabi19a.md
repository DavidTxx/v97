abstract: Systematic discriminatory biases present in our society influence the way
  data is collected and stored, the way variables are defined, and the way scientific
  findings are put into practice as policy. Automated decision procedures and learning
  algorithms applied to such data may serve to perpetuate existing injustice or unfairness
  in our society. In this paper, we consider how to make optimal but fair decisions,
  which “break the cycle of injustice” by correcting for the unfair dependence of
  both decisions and outcomes on sensitive features (e.g., variables that correspond
  to gender, race, disability, or other protected attributes). We use methods from
  causal inference and constrained optimization to learn optimal policies in a way
  that addresses multiple potential biases which afflict data analysis in sensitive
  contexts, extending the approach of Nabi & Shpitser (2018). Our proposal comes equipped
  with the theoretical guarantee that the chosen fair policy will induce a joint distribution
  for new instances that satisfies given fairness constraints. We illustrate our approach
  with both synthetic data and real criminal justice data.
