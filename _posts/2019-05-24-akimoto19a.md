abstract: High sensitivity of neural architecture search (NAS) methods against their
  input such as step-size (i.e., learning rate) and search space prevents practitioners
  from applying them out-of-the-box to their own problems, albeit its purpose is to
  automate a part of tuning process. Aiming at a fast, robust, and widely-applicable
  NAS, we develop a generic optimization framework for NAS. We turn a coupled optimization
  of connection weights and neural architecture into a differentiable optimization
  by means of stochastic relaxation. It accepts arbitrary search space (widely-applicable)
  and enables to employ a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of weights and
  architecture (fast). We propose a stochastic natural gradient method with an adaptive
  step-size mechanism built upon our theoretical investigation (robust). Despite its
  simplicity and no problem-dependent parameter tuning, our method exhibited near
  state-of-the-art performances with low computational budgets both on image classification
  and inpainting tasks.
