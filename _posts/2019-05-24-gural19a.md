abstract: In the age of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded devices ranging from ARM
  Cortex M0s with hundreds of KB of RAM to Arduinos with 2KB RAM are expected to perform
  increasingly sophisticated classification tasks, such as voice and gesture recognition,
  activity tracking, and biometric security. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
  together with spectrogram preprocessing, are a natural solution to many of these
  classification tasks, storage of the networkâ€™s activations often exceeds the hard
  memory constraints of embedded platforms. This paper presents memory-optimal direct
  convolutions as a way to push classification accuracy as high as possible given
  strict hardware memory constraints at the expense of extra compute. We therefore
  explore the opposite end of the compute-memory trade-off curve from standard approaches
  that minimize latency. We validate the memory-optimal CNN technique with an Arduino
  implementation of the 10-class MNIST classification task, fitting the network specification,
  weights, and activations entirely within 2KB SRAM and achieving a state-of-the-art
  classification accuracy for small-scale embedded systems of 99.15%.
