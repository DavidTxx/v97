abstract: 'We study the problem of learning-to-learn: infer- ring a learning algorithm
  that works well on a family of tasks sampled from an unknown distribution. As class
  of algorithms we consider Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on the true risk regularized
  by the square euclidean distance from a bias vector. We present an average excess
  risk bound for such a learning algorithm that quantifies the potential benefit of
  using a bias vector with respect to the unbiased case. We then propose a novel meta-algorithm
  to estimate the bias term online from a sequence of observed tasks. The small memory
  footprint and low time complexity of our approach makes it appealing in practice
  while our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on the generalization properties
  of the meta-algorithm on new tasks. A key feature of our results is that, when the
  number of tasks grows and their vari- ance is relatively small, our learning-to-learn
  approach has a significant advantage over learning each task in isolation by standard
  SGD without a bias term. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our approach in practice.'
