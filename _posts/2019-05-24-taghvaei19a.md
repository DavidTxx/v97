abstract: This paper presents a methodology and numerical algorithms for constructing
  accelerated gradient flows on the space of probability distributions. In particular,
  we extend the recent variational formulation of accelerated methods in (Wibisono
  et al., 2016) from vector valued variables to probability distributions. The variational
  problem is modeled as a mean-field optimal control problem. A quantitative estimate
  on the asymptotic convergence rate is provided based on a Lyapunov function construction,
  when the objective functional is displacement convex. An important special case
  is considered where the objective functional is the relative entropy. For this case,
  two numerical approximations are presented to implement the Hamiltonâ€™s equations
  as a system of N interacting particles. The algorithm is numerically illustrated
  and compared with the MCMC and Hamiltonian MCMC algorithms.
