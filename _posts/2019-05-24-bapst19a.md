abstract: Physical construction—the ability to compose objects, subject to physical
  dynamics, to serve some function—is fundamental to human intelligence. We introduce
  a suite of challenging physical construction tasks inspired by how children play
  with blocks, such as matching a target configuration, stacking blocks to connect
  objects together, and creating shelter-like structures over target objects. We examine
  how a range of deep reinforcement learning agents fare on these challenges, and
  introduce several new approaches which provide superior performance. Our results
  show that agents which use structured representations (e.g., objects and scene graphs)
  and structured policies (e.g., object-centric actions) outperform those which use
  less structured representations, and generalize better beyond their training when
  asked to reason about larger scenes. Model-based agents which use Monte-Carlo Tree
  Search also outperform strictly model-free agents in our most challenging construction
  problems. We conclude that approaches which combine structured representations and
  reasoning with powerful learning are a key path toward agents that possess rich
  intuitive physics, scene understanding, and planning.
