abstract: Mixture models trained via EM are among the simplest, most widely used and
  well understood latent variable models in the machine learning literature. Surprisingly,
  these models have been hardly explored in text generation applications such as machine
  translation. In principle, they provide a latent variable to control generation
  and produce a diverse set of hypotheses. In practice, however, mixture models are
  prone to degeneracies—often only one component gets trained or the latent variable
  is simply ignored. We find that disabling dropout noise in responsibility computation
  is critical to successful training. In addition, the design choices of parameterization,
  prior distribution, hard versus soft EM and online versus offline assignment can
  dramatically affect model performance. We develop an evaluation protocol to assess
  both quality and diversity of generations against multiple references, and provide
  an extensive empirical study of several mixture model variants. Our analysis shows
  that certain types of mixture models are more robust and offer the best trade-off
  between translation quality and diversity compared to variational models and diverse
  decoding approaches.\footnote{Code to reproduce the results in this paper is available
