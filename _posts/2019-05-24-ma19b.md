abstract: We introduce the implicit processes (IPs), a stochastic process that places
  implicitly defined multivariate distributions over any finite collections of random
  variables. IPs are therefore highly flexible implicit priors over <em>functions</em>,
  with examples including data simulators, Bayesian neural networks and non-linear
  transformations of stochastic processes. A novel and efficient approximate inference
  algorithm for IPs, namely the variational implicit processes (VIPs), is derived
  using generalised wake-sleep updates. This method returns simple update equations
  and allows scalable hyper-parameter learning with stochastic optimization. Experiments
  show that VIPs return better uncertainty estimates and lower errors over existing
  inference methods for challenging models such as Bayesian neural networks, and Gaussian
  processes.
