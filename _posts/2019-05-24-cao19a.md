abstract: Motivated by the phenomenon that companies introduce new products to keep
  abreast with customers’ rapidly changing tastes, we consider a novel online learning
  setting where a profit-maximizing seller needs to learn customers’ preferences through
  offering recommendations, which may contain existing products and new products that
  are launched in the middle of a selling period. We propose a sequential multinomial
  logit (SMNL) model to characterize customers’ behavior when product recommendations
  are presented in tiers. For the offline version with known customers’ preferences,
  we propose a polynomial-time algorithm and characterize the properties of the optimal
  tiered product recommendation. For the online problem, we propose a learning algorithm
  and quantify its regret bound. Moreover, we extend the setting to incorporate a
  constraint which ensures every new product is learned to a given accuracy. Our results
  demonstrate the tier structure can be used to mitigate the risks associated with
  learning new products.
