abstract: This work considers the problem of computing distances between structured
  objects such as undirected graphs, seen as probability distributions in a specific
  metric space. We consider a new transportation distance ( i.e. that minimizes a
  total cost of transporting probability masses) that unveils the geometric nature
  of the structured objects space. Unlike Wasserstein or Gromov-Wasserstein metrics
  that focus solely and respectively on features (by considering a metric in the feature
  space) or structure (by seeing structure as a metric space), our new distance exploits
  jointly both information, and is consequently called Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW).
  After discussing its properties and computational aspects, we show results on a
  graph classification task, where our method outperforms both graph kernels and deep
  graph convolutional networks. Exploiting further on the metric properties of FGW,
  interesting geometric objects such as Fr{é}chet means or barycenters of graphs are
  illustrated and discussed in a clustering context.
