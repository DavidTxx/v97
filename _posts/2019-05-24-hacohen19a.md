abstract: 'Training neural networks is traditionally done by providing a sequence
  of random mini-batches sampled uniformly from the entire training data. In this
  work, we analyze the effect of curriculum learning, which involves the non-uniform
  sampling of mini-batches, on the training of deep networks, and specifically CNNs
  trained for image recognition. To employ curriculum learning, the training algorithm
  must resolve 2 problems: (i) sort the training examples by difficulty; (ii) compute
  a series of mini-batches that exhibit an increasing level of difficulty. We address
  challenge (i) using two methods: transfer learning from some competitive â€œteacher"
  network, and bootstrapping. In our empirical evaluation, both methods show similar
  benefits in terms of increased learning speed and improved final performance on
  test data. We address challenge (ii) by investigating different pacing functions
  to guide the sampling. The empirical investigation includes a variety of network
  architectures, using images from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and subsets of ImageNet. We
  conclude with a novel theoretical analysis of curriculum learning, where we show
  how it effectively modifies the optimization landscape. We then define the concept
  of an ideal curriculum, and show that under mild conditions it does not change the
  corresponding global minimum of the optimization function.'
