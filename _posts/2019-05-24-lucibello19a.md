abstract: In Generalized Linear Estimation (GLE) problems, we seek to estimate a signal
  that is observed through a linear transform followed by a component-wise, possibly
  nonlinear and noisy, channel. In the Bayesian optimal setting, Generalized Approximate
  Message Passing (GAMP) is known to achieve optimal performance for GLE. However,
  its performance can significantly deteriorate whenever there is a mismatch between
  the assumed and the true generative model, a situation frequently encountered in
  practice. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named Generalized Approximate
  Survey Propagation (GASP), for solving GLE in the presence of prior or model misspecifications.
  As a prototypical example, we consider the phase retrieval problem, where we show
  that GASP outperforms the corresponding GAMP, reducing the reconstruction threshold
  and, for certain choices of its parameters, approaching Bayesian optimal performance.
  Furthermore, we present a set of state evolution equations that can precisely characterize
  the performance of GASP in the high-dimensional limit.
