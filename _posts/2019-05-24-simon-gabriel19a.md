abstract: 'Over the past few years, neural networks were proven vulnerable to adversarial
  images: targeted but imperceptible image perturbations lead to drastically different
  predictions. We show that adversarial vulnerability increases with the gradients
  of the training objective when viewed as a function of the inputs. Surprisingly,
  vulnerability does not depend on network topology: for many standard network architectures,
  we prove that at initialization, the L1-norm of these gradients grows as the square
  root of the input dimension, leaving the networks increasingly vulnerable with growing
  image size. We empirically show that this dimension-dependence persists after either
  usual or robust training, but gets attenuated with higher regularization.'
