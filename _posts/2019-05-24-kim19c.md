abstract: Exploration based on state novelty has brought great success in challenging
  reinforcement learning problems with sparse rewards. However, existing novelty-based
  strategies become inefficient in real-world problems where observation contains
  not only task-dependent state novelty of our interest but also task-irrelevant information
  that should be ignored. We introduce an information- theoretic exploration strategy
  named Curiosity-Bottleneck that distills task-relevant information from observation.
  Based on the information bottleneck principle, our exploration bonus is quantified
  as the compressiveness of observation with respect to the learned representation
  of a compressive value network. With extensive experiments on static image classification,
  grid-world and three hard-exploration Atari games, we show that Curiosity-Bottleneck
  learns an effective exploration strategy by robustly measuring the state novelty
  in distractive environments where state-of-the-art exploration methods often degenerate.
