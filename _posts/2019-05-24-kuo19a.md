abstract: We study the Short-and-Sparse (SaS) deconvolution problem of recovering
  a short signal a0 and a sparse signal x0 from their convolution. We propose a method
  based on nonconvex optimization, which under certain conditions recovers the target
  short and sparse signals, up to a signed shift symmetry which is intrinsic to this
  model. This symmetry plays a central role in shaping the optimization landscape
  for deconvolution. We give a regional analysis, which characterizes this landscape
  geometrically, on a union of subspaces. Our geometric characterization holds when
  the length-p0 short signal a0 has shift coherence {\textmu}, and x0 follows a random
  sparsity model with sparsity rate $\theta$ $\in$ [c1/p0, c2/(p0\sqrt{\mu}+\sqrt{p0})]
  / (log^2(p0)) . Based on this geometry, we give a provable method that successfully
  solves SaS deconvolution with high probability.
