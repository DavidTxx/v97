abstract: In one-class-learning tasks, only the normal case (foreground) can be modeled
  with data, whereas the variation of all possible anomalies is too erratic to be
  described by samples. Thus, due to the lack of representative data, the wide-spread
  discriminative approaches cannot cover such learning tasks, and rather generative
  models,which attempt to learn the input density of the foreground, are used. However,
  generative models suffer from a large input dimensionality (as in images) and are
  typically inefficient learners.We propose to learn the data distribution of the
  foreground more efficiently with a multi-hypotheses autoencoder. Moreover, the model
  is criticized by a discriminator, which prevents artificial data modes not supported
  by data, and which enforces diversity across hypotheses. Our multiple-hypotheses-based
  anomaly detection framework allows the reliable identification of out-of-distribution
  samples. For anomaly detection on CIFAR-10, it yields up to 3.9% points improvement
  over previously reported results. On a real anomaly detection task, the approach
  reduces the error of the baseline models from 6.8% to 1.5%.
