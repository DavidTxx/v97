abstract: 'The last few years have seen a staggering number of empirical studies of
  the robustness of neural networks in a model of adversarial perturbations of their
  inputs. Most rely on an adversary which carries out local modifications within prescribed
  balls. None however has so far questioned the broader picture: how to frame a <em>resource-bounded</em>
  adversary so that it can be <em>severely detrimental</em> to learning, a non-trivial
  problem which entails at a minimum the choice of loss and classifiers. We suggest
  a formal answer for losses that satisfy the minimal statistical requirement of being
  <em>proper</em>. We pin down a simple sufficient property for any given class of
  adversaries to be detrimental to learning, involving a central measure of “harmfulness”
  which generalizes the well-known class of integral probability metrics. A key feature
  of our result is that it holds for <em>all</em> proper losses, and for a popular
  subset of these, the optimisation of this central measure appears to be <em>independent
  of the loss</em>. When classifiers are Lipschitz – a now popular approach in adversarial
  training –, this optimisation resorts to <em>optimal transport</em> to make a low-budget
  compression of class marginals. Toy experiments reveal a finding recently separately
  observed: training against a sufficiently budgeted adversary of this kind <em>improves</em>
  generalization.'
