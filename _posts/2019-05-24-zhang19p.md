abstract: We identify a trade-off between robustness and accuracy that serves as a
  guiding principle in the design of defenses against adversarial examples. Although
  this problem has been widely studied empirically, much remains unknown concerning
  the theory underlying this trade-off. In this work, we decompose the prediction
  error for adversarial examples (robust error) as the sum of the natural (classification)
  error and boundary error, and provide a differentiable upper bound using the theory
  of classification-calibrated loss, which is shown to be the tightest possible upper
  bound uniform over all probability distributions and measurable predictors. Inspired
  by our theoretical analysis, we also design a new defense method, TRADES, to trade
  adversarial robustness off against accuracy. Our proposed algorithm performs well
  experimentally in real-world datasets. The methodology is the foundation of our
  entry to the NeurIPS 2018 Adversarial Vision Challenge in which we won the 1st place
  out of Â 2,000 submissions, surpassing the runner-up approach by 11.41% in terms
  of mean L_2 perturbation distance.
