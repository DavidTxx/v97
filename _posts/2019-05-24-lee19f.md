abstract: Large-scale datasets may contain significant proportions of noisy (incorrect)
  class labels, and it is well-known that modern deep neural networks (DNNs) poorly
  generalize from such noisy training datasets. To mitigate the issue, we propose
  a novel inference method, termed Robust Generative classifier (RoG), applicable
  to any discriminative (e.g., softmax) neural classifier pre-trained on noisy datasets.
  In particular, we induce a generative classifier on top of hidden feature spaces
  of the pre-trained DNNs, for obtaining a more robust decision boundary. By estimating
  the parameters of generative classifier using the minimum covariance determinant
  estimator, we significantly improve the classification accuracy with neither re-training
  of the deep model nor changing its architectures. With the assumption of Gaussian
  distribution for features, we prove that RoG generalizes better than baselines under
  noisy labels. Finally, we propose the ensemble version of RoG to improve its performance
  by investigating the layer-wise characteristics of DNNs. Our extensive experimental
  results demonstrate the superiority of RoG given different learning models optimized
  by several training techniques to handle diverse scenarios of noisy labels.
