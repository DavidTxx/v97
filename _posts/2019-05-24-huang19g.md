abstract: In many scientific fields, such as economics and neuroscience, we are often
  faced with nonstationary time series, and concerned with both finding causal relations
  and forecasting the values of variables of interest, both of which are particularly
  challenging in such nonstationary environments. In this paper, we study causal discovery
  and forecasting for nonstationary time series. By exploiting a particular type of
  state-space model to represent the processes, we show that nonstationarity helps
  to identify the causal structure, and that forecasting naturally benefits from learned
  causal knowledge. Specifically, we allow changes in both causal strengths and noise
  variances in the nonlinear state-space models, which, interestingly, renders both
  the causal structure and model parameters identifiable. Given the causal model,
  we treat forecasting as a problem in Bayesian inference in the causal model, which
  exploits the time-varying property of the data and adapts to new observations in
  a principled manner. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets
  demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.
