abstract: Most deep learning classification studies assume clean data. However, when
  dealing with the real world data, we encounter three problems such as 1) missing
  data, 2) class imbalance, and 3) missing label problems. These problems undermine
  the performance of a classifier. Various preprocessing techniques have been proposed
  to mitigate one of these problems, but an algorithm that assumes and resolves all
  three problems together has not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose HexaGAN,
  a generative adversarial network framework that shows promising classification performance
  for all three problems. We interpret the three problems from a single perspective
  to solve them jointly. To enable this, the framework consists of six components,
  which interact with each other. We also devise novel loss functions corresponding
  to the architecture. The designed loss functions allow us to achieve state-of-the-art
  imputation performance, with up to a 14% improvement, and to generate high-quality
  class-conditional data. We evaluate the classification performance (F1-score) of
  the proposed method with 20% missingness and confirm up to a 5% improvement in comparison
  with the performance of combinations of state-of-the-art methods.
