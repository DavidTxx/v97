abstract: We propose a unified mechanism for achieving coordination and communication
  in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), through rewarding agents for having
  causal influence over other agents’ actions. Causal influence is assessed using
  counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep, an agent simulates alternate actions
  that it could have taken, and computes their effect on the behavior of other agents.
  Actions that lead to bigger changes in other agents’ behavior are considered influential
  and are rewarded. We show that this is equivalent to rewarding agents for having
  high mutual information between their actions. Empirical results demonstrate that
  influence leads to enhanced coordination and communication in challenging social
  dilemma environments, dramatically increasing the learning curves of the deep RL
  agents, and leading to more meaningful learned communication protocols. The influence
  rewards for all agents can be computed in a decentralized way by enabling agents
  to learn a model of other agents using deep neural networks. In contrast, key previous
  works on emergent communication in the MARL setting were unable to learn diverse
  policies in a decentralized manner and had to resort to centralized training. Consequently,
  the influence reward opens up a window of new opportunities for research in this
  area.
