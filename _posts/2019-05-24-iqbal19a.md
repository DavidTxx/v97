abstract: Reinforcement learning in multi-agent scenarios is important for real-world
  applications but presents challenges beyond those seen in single-agent settings.
  We present an actor-critic algorithm that trains decentralized policies in multi-agent
  settings, using centrally computed critics that share an attention mechanism which
  selects relevant information for each agent at every timestep. This attention mechanism
  enables more effective and scalable learning in complex multi-agent environments,
  when compared to recent approaches. Our approach is applicable not only to cooperative
  settings with shared rewards, but also individualized reward settings, including
  adversarial settings, as well as settings that do not provide global states, and
  it makes no assumptions about the action spaces of the agents. As such, it is flexible
  enough to be applied to most multi-agent learning problems.
