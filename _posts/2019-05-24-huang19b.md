abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success
  in computer vision by supervisedly learning strong visual feature representations.
  However, training CNNs relies heavily on the availability of exhaustive training
  data annotations, limiting significantly their deployment and scalability in many
  application scenarios. In this work, we introduce a generic unsupervised deep learning
  approach to training deep models without the need for any manual label supervision.
  Specifically, we progressively discover sample anchored/centred neighbourhoods to
  reason and learn the underlying class decision boundaries iteratively and accumulatively.
  Every single neighbourhood is specially formulated so that all the member samples
  can share the same unseen class labels at high probability for facilitating the
  extraction of class discriminative feature representations during training. Experiments
  on image classification show the performance advantages of the proposed method over
  the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models on six benchmarks including both
  coarse-grained and fine-grained object image categorisation.
