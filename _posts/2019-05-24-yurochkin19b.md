abstract: We propose Dirichlet Simplex Nest, a class of probabilistic models suitable
  for a variety of data types, and develop fast and provably accurate inference algorithms
  by accounting for the modelâ€™s convex geometry and low dimensional simplicial structure.
  By exploiting the connection to Voronoi tessellation and properties of Dirichlet
  distribution, the proposed inference algorithm is shown to achieve consistency and
  strong error bound guarantees on a range of model settings and data distributions.
  The effectiveness of our model and the learning algorithm is demonstrated by simulations
  and by analyses of text and financial data.
