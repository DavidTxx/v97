abstract: A key challenge in leveraging data augmentation for neural network training
  is choosing an effective augmentation policy from a large search space of candidate
  operations. Properly chosen augmentation policies can lead to significant generalization
  improvements; however, state-of-the-art approaches such as AutoAugment are computationally
  infeasible to run for the ordinary user. In this paper, we introduce a new data
  augmentation algorithm, Population Based Augmentation (PBA), which generates nonstationary
  augmentation policy schedules instead of a fixed augmentation policy. We show that
  PBA can match the performance of AutoAugment on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with
  three orders of magnitude less overall compute. On CIFAR-10 we achieve a mean test
  error of 1.46%, which is a slight improvement upon the current state-of-the-art.
  The code for PBA is open source and is available at https://github.com/arcelien/pba.
