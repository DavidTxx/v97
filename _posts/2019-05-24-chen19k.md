abstract: An important class of non-convex objectives that has wide applications in
  machine learning consists of a sum of $n$ smooth functions and a non-smooth convex
  function. Tremendous studies have been devoted to conquering these problems by leveraging
  one of the two types of variance reduction techniques, i.e., SVRG-type that computes
  a full gradient occasionally and SAGA-type that maintains $n$ stochastic gradients
  at every iteration. In practice, SVRG-type is preferred to SAGA-type due to its
  potentially less memory costs. An interesting question that has been largely ignored
  is how to improve the complexity of variance reduction methods for problems with
  a large condition number that measures the degree to which the objective is close
  to a convex function. In this paper, we present a simple but non-trivial boosting
  of a state-of-the-art SVRG-type method for convex problems (namely Katyusha) to
  enjoy an improved complexity for solving non-convex problems with a large condition
  number (that is close to a convex function). To the best of our knowledge, its complexity
  has the best dependence on $n$ and the degree of non-convexity, and also matches
  that of a recent SAGA-type accelerated stochastic algorithm for a constrained non-convex
  smooth optimization problem.
