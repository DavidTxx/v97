abstract: Recently, a number of learning-based optimization methods that combine data-driven
  architectures with the classical optimization algorithms have been proposed and
  explored, showing superior empirical performance in solving various ill-posed inverse
  problems, but there is still a scarcity of rigorous analysis about the convergence
  behaviors of learning-based optimization. In particular, most existing analyses
  are specific to unconstrained problems but cannot apply to the more general cases
  where some variables of interest are subject to certain constraints. In this paper,
  we propose Differentiable Linearized ADMM (D-LADMM) for solving the problems with
  linear constraints. Specifically, D-LADMM is a K-layer LADMM inspired deep neural
  network, which is obtained by firstly introducing some learnable weights in the
  classical Linearized ADMM algorithm and then generalizing the proximal operator
  to some learnable activation function. Notably, we rigorously prove that there exist
  a set of learnable parameters for D-LADMM to generate globally converged solutions,
  and we show that those desired parameters can be attained by training D-LADMM in
  a proper way. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide the convergence
  analysis for the learning-based optimization method on constrained problems.
