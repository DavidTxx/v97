abstract: Beam search is the most popular inference algorithm for decoding neural
  sequence models. Unlike greedy search, beam search allows for non-greedy local decisions
  that can potentially lead to a sequence with a higher overall probability. However,
  work on a number of applications has found that the quality of the highest probability
  hypothesis found by beam search degrades with large beam widths. We perform an empirical
  study of the behavior of beam search across three sequence synthesis tasks. We find
  that increasing the beam width leads to sequences that are disproportionately based
  on early, very low probability tokens that are followed by a sequence of tokens
  with higher (conditional) probability. We show that, empirically, such sequences
  are more likely to have a lower evaluation score than lower probability sequences
  without this pattern. Using the notion of search discrepancies from heuristic search,
  we hypothesize that large discrepancies are the cause of the performance degradation.
  We show that this hypothesis generalizes the previous ones in machine translation
  and image captioning. To validate our hypothesis, we show that constraining beam
  search to avoid large discrepancies eliminates the performance degradation.
