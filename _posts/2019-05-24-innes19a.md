abstract: Structured models of decision making often assume an agent is aware of all
  possible states and actions in advance. This assumption is sometimes untenable.
  In this paper, we learn Bayesian Decision Networks from both domain exploration
  and expert assertions in a way which guarantees convergence to optimal behaviour,
  even when the agent starts unaware of actions or belief variables that are critical
  to success. Our experiments show that our agent learns optimal behaviour on both
  small and large decision problems, and that allowing an agent to conserve information
  upon making new discoveries results in faster convergence.
