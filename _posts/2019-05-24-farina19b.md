abstract: Regret minimization is a powerful tool for solving large-scale problems;
  it was recently used in breakthrough results for large-scale extensive-form game
  solving. This was achieved by composing simplex regret minimizers into an overall
  regret-minimization framework for extensive-form game strategy spaces. In this paper
  we study the general composability of regret minimizers. We derive a calculus for
  constructing regret minimizers for composite convex sets that are obtained from
  convexity-preserving operations on simpler convex sets. We show that local regret
  minimizers for the simpler sets can be combined with additional regret minimizers
  into an aggregate regret minimizer for the composite set. As one application, we
  show that the CFR framework can be constructed easily from our framework. We also
  show ways to include curtailing (constraining) operations into our framework. For
  one, they enable the construction of CFR generalization for extensive-form games
  with general convex strategy constraints that can cut across decision points.
