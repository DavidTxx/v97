abstract: We investigate deep Bayesian neural networks with Gaussian priors on the
  weights and a class of ReLU-like nonlinearities. Bayesian neural networks with Gaussian
  priors are well known to induce an L2, “weight decay”, regularization. Our results
  indicate a more intricate regularization effect at the level of the unit activations.
  Our main result establishes that the induced prior distribution on the units before
  and after activation becomes increasingly heavy-tailed with the depth of the layer.
  We show that first layer units are Gaussian, second layer units are sub-exponential,
  and units in deeper layers are characterized by sub-Weibull distributions. Our results
  provide new theoretical insight on deep Bayesian neural networks, which we corroborate
  with simulation experiments.
