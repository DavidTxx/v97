abstract: Adaptive regularization methods pre-multiply a descent direction by a preconditioning
  matrix. Due to the large number of parameters of machine learning problems, full-matrix
  preconditioning methods are prohibitively expensive. We show how to modify full-matrix
  adaptive regularization in order to make it practical and effective. We also provide
  a novel theoretical analysis for adaptive regularization in <em>non-convex</em>
  optimization settings. The core of our algorithm, termed GGT, consists of the efficient
  computation of the inverse square root of a low-rank matrix. Our preliminary experiments
  show improved iteration-wise convergence rates across synthetic tasks and standard
  deep learning benchmarks, and that the more carefully-preconditioned steps sometimes
  lead to a better solution.
