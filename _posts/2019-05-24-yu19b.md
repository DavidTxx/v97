abstract: Learning with noisy labels is one of the hottest problems in weakly-supervised
  learning. Based on memorization effects of deep neural networks, training on small-loss
  instances becomes very promising for handling noisy labels. This fosters the state-of-the-art
  approach "Co-teaching" that cross-trains two deep neural networks using the small-loss
  trick. However, with the increase of epochs, two networks converge to a consensus
  and Co-teaching reduces to the self-training MentorNet. To tackle this issue, we
  propose a robust learning paradigm called Co-teaching+, which bridges the "Update
  by Disagreement‚Äù strategy with the original Co-teaching. First, two networks feed
  forward and predict all data, but keep prediction disagreement data only. Then,
  among such disagreement data, each network selects its small-loss data, but back
  propagates the small-loss data from its peer network and updates its own parameters.
  Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Co-teaching+ is much superior
  to many state-of-the-art methods in the robustness of trained models.
