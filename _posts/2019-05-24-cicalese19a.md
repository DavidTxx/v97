abstract: 'We study the problem of optimizing the clustering of a set of vectors when
  the quality of the clustering is measured by the Entropy or the Gini impurity measure.
  Our results contribute to the state of the art both in terms of best known approximation
  guarantees and inapproximability bounds: (i) we give the first polynomial time algorithm
  for Entropy impurity based clustering with approximation guarantee independent of
  the number of vectors and (ii) we show that the problem of clustering based on entropy
  impurity does not admit a PTAS. This also implies an inapproximability result in
  information theoretic clustering for probability distributions closing a problem
  left open in [Chaudhury and McGregor, COLT08] and [Ackermann et al., ECCC11]. We
  also report experiments with a new clustering method that was designed on top of
  the theoretical tools leading to the above results. These experiments suggest a
  practical applicability for our method, in particular, when the number of clusters
  is large.'
