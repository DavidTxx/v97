abstract: Model selection is an essential task for many applications in scientific
  discovery. The most common approaches rely on univariate linear measures of association
  between each feature and the outcome. Such classical selection procedures fail to
  take into account nonlinear effects and interactions between features. Kernel-based
  selection procedures have been proposed as a solution. However, current strategies
  for kernel selection fail to measure the significance of a joint model constructed
  through the combination of the basis kernels. In the present work, we exploit recent
  advances in post-selection inference to propose a valid statistical test for the
  association of a joint model of the selected kernels with the outcome. The kernels
  are selected via a step-wise procedure which we model as a succession of quadratic
  constraints in the outcome variable.
