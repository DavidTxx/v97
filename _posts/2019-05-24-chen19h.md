abstract: 'This paper provides a simple procedure to fit generative networks to target
  distributions, with the goal of a small Wasserstein distance (or other optimal transport
  costs). The approach is based on two principles: (a) if the source randomness of
  the network is a continuous distribution (the "semi-discrete" setting), then the
  Wasserstein distance is realized by a deterministic optimal transport mapping; (b)
  given an optimal transport mapping between a generator network and a target distribution,
  the Wasserstein distance may be decreased via a regression between the generated
  data and the mapped target points. The procedure here therefore alternates these
  two steps, forming an optimal transport and regressing against it, gradually adjusting
  the generator network towards the target distribution. Mathematically, this approach
  is shown to minimize the Wasserstein distance to both the empirical target distribution,
  and also its underlying population counterpart. Empirically, good performance is
  demonstrated on the training and testing sets of the MNIST and Thin-8 data. The
  paper closes with a discussion of the unsuitability of the Wasserstein distance
  for certain tasks, as has been identified in prior work (Arora et al., 2017; Huang
  et al., 2017).'
