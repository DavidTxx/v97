abstract: 'In this paper, we study the prediction of a real-valued target, such as
  a risk score or recidivism rate, while guaranteeing a quantitative notion of fairness
  with respect to a protected attribute such as gender or race. We call this class
  of problems fair regression. We propose general schemes for fair regression under
  two notions of fairness: (1) statistical parity, which asks that the prediction
  be statistically independent of the protected attribute, and (2) bounded group loss,
  which asks that the prediction error restricted to any protected group remain below
  some pre-determined level. While we only study these two notions of fairness, our
  schemes are applicable to arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous losses, and so they encompass
  least-squares regression, logistic regression, quantile regression, and many other
  tasks. Our schemes only require access to standard risk minimization algorithms
  (such as standard classification or least-squares regression) while providing theoretical
  guarantees on the optimality and fairness of the obtained solutions. In addition
  to analyzing theoretical properties of our schemes, we empirically demonstrate their
  ability to uncover fairnessâ€“accuracy frontiers on several standard datasets.'
