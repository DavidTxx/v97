abstract: One of the main challenges in reinforcement learning is solving tasks with
  sparse reward. We show that the difficulty of discovering a distant rewarding state
  in an MDP is bounded by the expected cover time of a random walk over the graph
  induced by the MDPâ€™s transition dynamics. We therefore propose to accelerate exploration
  by constructing options that minimize cover time. We introduce a new option discovery
  algorithm that diminishes the expected cover time by connecting the most distant
  states in the state-space graph with options. We show empirically that the proposed
  algorithm improves learning in several domains with sparse rewards.
