abstract: In this paper, we study the generative models of sequential discrete data.
  To tackle the exposure bias problem inherent in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),
  generative adversarial networks (GANs) are introduced to penalize the unrealistic
  generated samples. To exploit the supervision signal from the discriminator, most
  previous models leverage REINFORCE to address the non-differentiable problem of
  sequential discrete data. However, because of the unstable property of the training
  signal during the dynamic process of adversarial training, the effectiveness of
  REINFORCE, in this case, is hardly guaranteed. To deal with such a problem, we propose
  a novel approach called Cooperative Training (CoT) to improve the training of sequence
  generative models. CoT transforms the min-max game of GANs into a joint maximization
  framework and manages to explicitly estimate and optimize Jensen-Shannon divergence.
  Moreover, CoT works without the necessity of pre-training via MLE, which is crucial
  to the success of previous methods. In the experiments, compared to existing state-of-the-art
  methods, CoT shows superior or at least competitive performance on sample quality,
  diversity, as well as training stability.
