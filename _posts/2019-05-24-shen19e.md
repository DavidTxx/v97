abstract: 'In this paper, we study a simple and generic framework to tackle the problem
  of learning model parameters when a fraction of the training samples are corrupted.
  Our approach is motivated by a simple observation: in a variety of such settings,
  the evolution of training accuracy (as a function of training epochs) is different
  for clean samples and bad samples. We propose to iteratively minimize the trimmed
  loss, by alternating between (a) selecting samples with lowest current loss, and
  (b) retraining a model on only these samples. Analytically, we characterize the
  statistical performance and convergence rate of the algorithm for simple and natural
  linear and non-linear models. Experimentally, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
  three settings: (a) deep image classifiers with errors only in labels, (b) generative
  adversarial networks with bad training images, and (c) deep image classifiers with
  adversarial (image, label) pairs (i.e., backdoor attacks). For the well-studied
  setting of random label noise, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance
  without having access to any a-priori guaranteed clean samples.'
