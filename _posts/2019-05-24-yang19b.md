abstract: Consider a Markov decision process (MDP) that admits a set of state-action
  features, which can linearly express the processâ€™s probabilistic transition model.
  We propose a parametric Q-learning algorithm that finds an approximate-optimal policy
  using a sample size proportional to the feature dimension $K$ and invariant with
  respect to the size of the state space. To further improve its sample efficiency,
  we exploit the monotonicity property and intrinsic noise structure of the Bellman
  operator, provided the existence of anchor state-actions that imply implicit non-negativity
  in the feature space. We augment the algorithm using techniques of variance reduction,
  monotonicity preservation, and confidence bounds. It is proved to find a policy
  which is $\epsilon$-optimal from any initial state with high probability using $\widetilde{O}(K/\epsilon^2(1-\gamma)^3)$
  sample transitions for arbitrarily large-scale MDP with a discount factor $\gamma\in(0,1)$.
  A matching information-theoretical lower bound is proved, confirming the sample
  optimality of the proposed method with respect to all parameters (up to polylog
  factors).
