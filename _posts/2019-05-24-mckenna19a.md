abstract: Many privacy mechanisms reveal high-level information about a data distribution
  through noisy measurements. It is common to use this information to estimate the
  answers to new queries. In this work, we provide an approach to solve this estimation
  problem efficiently using graphical models, which is particularly effective when
  the distribution is high-dimensional but the measurements are over low-dimensional
  marginals. We show that our approach is far more efficient than existing estimation
  techniques from the privacy literature and that it can improve the accuracy and
  scalability of many state-of-the-art mechanisms.
