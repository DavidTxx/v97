abstract: We propose a contextual-bandit approach for demand side management by offering
  price incentives. More precisely, a target mean consumption is set at each round
  and the mean consumption is modeled as a complex function of the distribution of
  prices sent and of some contextual variables such as the temperature, weather, and
  so on. The performance of our strategies is measured in quadratic losses through
  a regret criterion. We offer $T^{2/3}$ upper bounds on this regret (up to poly-logarithmic
  terms)—and even faster rates under stronger assumptions—for strategies inspired
  by standard strategies for contextual bandits (like LinUCB, see Li et al., 2010).
  Simulations on a real data set gathered by UK Power Networks, in which price incentives
  were offered, show that our strategies are effective and may indeed manage demand
  response by suitably picking the price levels.
