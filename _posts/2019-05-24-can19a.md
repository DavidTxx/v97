abstract: Momentum methods such as Polyak’s heavy ball (HB) method, Nesterov’s accelerated
  gradient (AG) as well as accelerated projected gradient (APG) method have been commonly
  used in machine learning practice, but their performance is quite sensitive to noise
  in the gradients. We study these methods under a first-order stochastic oracle model
  where noisy estimates of the gradients are available. For strongly convex problems,
  we show that the distribution of the iterates of AG converges with the accelerated
  $O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ linear rate to a ball of radius $\varepsilon$
  centered at a unique invariant distribution in the 1-Wasserstein metric where $\kappa$
  is the condition number as long as the noise variance is smaller than an explicit
  upper bound we can provide. Our analysis also certifies linear convergence rates
  as a function of the stepsize, momentum parameter and the noise variance; recovering
  the accelerated rates in the noiseless case and quantifying the level of noise that
  can be tolerated to achieve a given performance. To the best of our knowledge, these
  are the first linear convergence results for stochastic momentum methods under the
  stochastic oracle model. We also develop finer results for the special case of quadratic
  objectives, extend our results to the APG method and weakly convex functions showing
  accelerated rates when the noise magnitude is sufficiently small.
