abstract: Fatorization machines (FM) are a popular model class to learn pairwise interactions
  by a low-rank approximation. Different from existing FM-based approaches which use
  a fixed rank for all features, this paper proposes a Rank-Aware FM (RaFM) model
  which adopts pairwise interactions from embeddings with different ranks. The proposed
  model achieves a better performance on real-world datasets where different features
  have significantly varying frequencies of occurrences. Moreover, we prove that the
  RaFM model can be stored, evaluated, and trained as efficiently as one single FM,
  and under some reasonable conditions it can be even significantly more efficient
  than FM. RaFM improves the performance of FMs in both regression tasks and classification
  tasks while incurring less computational burden, therefore also has attractive potential
  in industrial applications.
