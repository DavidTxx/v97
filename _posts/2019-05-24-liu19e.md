abstract: Stochastic multi-armed bandits form a class of online learning problems
  that have important applications in online recommendation systems, adaptive medical
  treatment, and many others. Even though potential attacks against these learning
  algorithms may hijack their behavior, causing catastrophic loss in real-world applications,
  little is known about adversarial attacks on bandit algorithms. In this paper, we
  propose a framework of offline attacks on bandit algorithms and study convex optimization
  based attacks on several popular bandit algorithms. We show that the attacker can
  force the bandit algorithm to pull a target arm with high probability by a slight
  manipulation of the rewards in the data. Then we study a form of online attacks
  on bandit algorithms and propose an adaptive attack strategy against any bandit
  algorithm without the knowledge of the bandit algorithm. Our adaptive attack strategy
  can hijack the behavior of the bandit algorithm to suffer a linear regret with only
  a logarithmic cost to the attacker. Our results demonstrate a significant security
  threat to stochastic bandits.
