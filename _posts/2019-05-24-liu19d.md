abstract: The pioneering work of sparse local embeddings for extreme classification
  (SLEEC) (Bhatia et al., 2015) has shown great promise in multi-label learning. Unfortunately,
  the statistical rate of convergence and oracle property of SLEEC are still not well
  understood. To fill this gap, we present a unified framework for SLEEC with nonconvex
  penalty. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that our proposed estimator enjoys oracle
  property (i.e., performs as well as if the underlying model were known beforehand),
  and obtains a desirable statistical convergence rate. Moreover, we show that under
  a mild condition on the magnitude of the entries in the underlying model, we are
  able to obtain an improved convergence rate. Extensive numerical experiments verify
  our theoretical findings and the superiority of our proposed estimator.
