abstract: Supervised training of neural networks for classification is typically performed
  with a global loss function. The loss function provides a gradient for the output
  layer, and this gradient is back-propagated to hidden layers to dictate an update
  direction for the weights. An alternative approach is to train the network with
  layer-wise loss functions. In this paper we demonstrate, for the first time, that
  layer-wise training can approach the state-of-the-art on a variety of image datasets.
  We use single-layer sub-networks and two different supervised loss functions to
  generate local error signals for the hidden layers, and we show that the combination
  of these losses help with optimization in the context of local learning. Using local
  errors could be a step towards more biologically plausible deep learning because
  the global error does not have to be transported back to hidden layers. A completely
  backprop free variant outperforms previously reported results among methods aiming
  for higher biological plausibility.
