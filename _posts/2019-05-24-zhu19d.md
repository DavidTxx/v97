abstract: In computer vision applications, such as domain adaptation (DA), few shot
  learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), we encounter new objects and environments,
  for which insufficient examples exist to allow for training “models from scratch,”
  and methods that adapt existing models, trained on the presented training environment,
  to the new scenario are required. We propose a novel visual attribute encoding method
  that encodes each image as a low-dimensional probability vector composed of prototypical
  part-type probabilities. The prototypes are learnt to be representative of all training
  data. At test-time we utilize this encoding as an input to a classifier. At test-time
  we freeze the encoder and only learn/adapt the classifier component to limited annotated
  labels in FSL; new semantic attributes in ZSL. We conduct extensive experiments
  on benchmark datasets. Our method outperforms state-of-art methods trained for the
  specific contexts (ZSL, FSL, DA).
