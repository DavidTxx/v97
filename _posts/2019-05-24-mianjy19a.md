abstract: We give a formal and complete characterization of the explicit regularizer
  induced by dropout in deep linear networks with squared loss. We show that (a) the
  explicit regularizer is composed of an $\ell_2$-path regularizer and other terms
  that are also re-scaling invariant, (b) the convex envelope of the induced regularizer
  is the squared nuclear norm of the network map, and (c) for a sufficiently large
  dropout rate, we characterize the global optima of the dropout objective. We validate
  our theoretical findings with empirical results.
