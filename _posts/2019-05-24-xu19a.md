abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised machine learning. Lloyd’s
  1957 algorithm for k-means clustering remains one of the most widely used due to
  its speed and simplicity, but the greedy approach is sensitive to initialization
  and often falls short at a poor solution. This paper explores an alternative to
  Lloyd’s algorithm that retains its simplicity and mitigates its tendency to get
  trapped by local minima. Called power k-means, our method embeds the k-means problem
  in a continuous class of similar, better behaved problems with fewer local minima.
  Power k-means anneals its way toward the solution of ordinary k-means by way of
  majorization-minimization (MM), sharing the appealing descent property and low complexity
  of Lloyd’s algorithm. Further, our method complements widely used seeding strategies,
  reaping marked improvements when used together as demonstrated on a suite of simulated
  and real data examples.
