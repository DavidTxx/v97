abstract: To address the challenge of backpropagating the gradient through categorical
  variables, we propose the augment-REINFORCE-swap-merge (ARSM) gradient estimator
  that is unbiased and has low variance. ARSM first uses variable augmentation, REINFORCE,
  and Rao-Blackwellization to re-express the gradient as an expectation under the
  Dirichlet distribution, then uses variable swapping to construct differently expressed
  but equivalent expectations, and finally shares common random numbers between these
  expectations to achieve significant variance reduction. Experimental results show
  ARSM closely resembles the performance of the true gradient for optimization in
  univariate settings; outperforms existing estimators by a large margin when applied
  to categorical variational auto-encoders; and provides a "try-and-see self-critic"
  variance reduction method for discrete-action policy gradient, which removes the
  need of estimating baselines by generating a random number of pseudo actions and
  estimating their action-value functions.
