abstract: 'In this work we analyse quantitatively the interplay between the loss landscape
  and performance of descent algorithms in a prototypical inference problem, the spiked
  matrix-tensor model. We study a loss function that is the negative log-likelihood
  of the model. We analyse the number of local minima at a fixed distance from the
  signal/spike with the Kac-Rice formula, and locate trivialization of the landscape
  at large signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate analytically the performance of a gradient
  flow algorithm using integro-differential PDEs as developed in physics of disordered
  systems for the Langevin dynamics. We analyze the performance of an approximate
  message passing algorithm estimating the maximum likelihood configuration via its
  state evolution. We conclude by comparing the above results: while we observe a
  drastic slow down of the gradient flow dynamics even in the region where the landscape
  is trivial, both the analyzed algorithms are shown to perform well even in the part
  of the region of parameters where spurious local minima are present.'
