abstract: We propose a method for tackling catastrophic forgetting in deep reinforcement
  learning that is <em>agnostic</em> to the timescale of changes in the distribution
  of experiences, does not require knowledge of task boundaries and can adapt in <em>continuously</em>
  changing environments. In our <em>policy consolidation</em> model, the policy network
  interacts with a cascade of hidden networks that simultaneously remember the agentâ€™s
  policy at a range of timescales and regularise the current policy by its own history,
  thereby improving its ability to learn without forgetting. We find that the model
  improves continual learning relative to baselines on a number of continuous control
  tasks in single-task, alternating two-task, and multi-agent competitive self-play
  settings.
