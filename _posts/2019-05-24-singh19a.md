abstract: The advent of generative adversarial networks (GAN) has enabled new capabilities
  in synthesis, interpolation, and data augmentation heretofore considered very challenging.
  However, one of the common assumptions in most GAN architectures is the assumption
  of simple parametric latent-space distributions. While easy to implement, a simple
  latent-space distribution can be problematic for uses such as interpolation. This
  is due to distributional mismatches when samples are interpolated in the latent
  space. We present a straightforward formalization of this problem; using basic results
  from probability theory and off-the-shelf-optimization tools, we develop ways to
  arrive at appropriate non-parametric priors. The obtained prior exhibits unusual
  qualitative properties in terms of its shape, and quantitative benefits in terms
  of lower divergence with its mid-point distribution. We demonstrate that our designed
  prior helps improve image generation along any Euclidean straight line during interpolation,
  both qualitatively and quantitatively, without any additional training or architectural
  modifications. The proposed formulation is quite flexible, paving the way to impose
  newer constraints on the latent-space statistics.
