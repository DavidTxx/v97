abstract: 'We introduce a novel approach, requiring only mild assumptions, for the
  characterization of deep neural networks at initialization. Our approach applies
  both to fully-connected and convolutional networks and easily incorporates batch
  normalization and skip-connections. Our key insight is to consider the evolution
  with depth of statistical moments of signal and noise, thereby characterizing the
  presence or absence of pathologies in the hypothesis space encoded by the choice
  of hyperparameters. We establish: (i) for feedforward networks, with and without
  batch normalization, the multiplicativity of layer composition inevitably leads
  to ill-behaved moments and pathologies; (ii) for residual networks with batch normalization,
  on the other hand, skip-connections induce power-law rather than exponential behaviour,
  leading to well-behaved moments and no pathology.'
