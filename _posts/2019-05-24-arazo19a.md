abstract: Despite being robust to small amounts of label noise, convolutional neural
  networks trained with stochastic gradient methods have been shown to easily fit
  random labels. When there are a mixture of correct and mislabelled targets, networks
  tend to fit the former before the latter. This suggests using a suitable two-component
  mixture model as an unsupervised generative model of sample loss values during training
  to allow online estimation of the probability that a sample is mislabelled. Specifically,
  we propose a beta mixture to estimate this probability and correct the loss by relying
  on the network prediction (the so-called bootstrapping loss). We further adapt mixup
  augmentation to drive our approach a step further. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and
  TinyImageNet demonstrate a robustness to label noise that substantially outperforms
  recent state-of-the-art. Source code is available at https://git.io/fjsvE and Appendix
  at https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11238.
