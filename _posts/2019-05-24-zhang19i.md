abstract: This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised domain adaption from theoretical
  and algorithmic perspectives. Existing domain adaptation theories naturally imply
  minimax optimization algorithms, which connect well with the domain adaptation methods
  based on adversarial learning. However, several disconnections still exist and form
  the gap between theory and algorithm. We extend previous theories (Mansour et al.,
  2009c; Ben-David et al., 2010) to multiclass classification in domain adaptation,
  where classifiers based on the scoring functions and margin loss are standard choices
  in algorithm design. We introduce Margin Disparity Discrepancy, a novel measurement
  with rigorous generalization bounds, tailored to the distribution comparison with
  the asymmetric margin loss, and to the minimax optimization for easier training.
  Our theory can be seamlessly transformed into an adversarial learning algorithm
  for domain adaptation, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm.
  A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves the state of the
  art accuracies on challenging domain adaptation tasks.
