abstract: Abstractive summarization has been studied using neural sequence transduction
  methods with datasets of large, paired document-summary examples. However, such
  datasets are rare and the models trained from them do not generalize to other domains.
  Recently, some progress has been made in learning sequence-to-sequence mappings
  with only unpaired examples. In our work, we consider the setting where there are
  only documents (product or business reviews) with no summaries provided, and propose
  an end-to-end, neural model architecture to perform unsupervised abstractive summarization.
  Our proposed model consists of an auto-encoder where the mean of the representations
  of the input reviews decodes to a reasonable summary-review. We consider variants
  of the proposed architecture and perform an ablation study to show the importance
  of specific components. We show through metrics and human evaluation that the generated
  summaries are highly abstractive, fluent, relevant, and representative of the average
  sentiment of the input reviews. Finally, we collect a ground-truth evaluation dataset
  and show that our model outperforms a strong extractive baseline.
