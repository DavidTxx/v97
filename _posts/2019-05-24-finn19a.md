abstract: A central capability of intelligent systems is the ability to continuously
  build upon previous experiences to speed up and enhance learning of new tasks. Two
  distinct research paradigms have studied this question. Meta-learning views this
  problem as learning a prior over model parameters that is amenable for fast adaptation
  on a new task, but typically assumes the tasks are available together as a batch.
  In contrast, online (regret based) learning considers a setting where tasks are
  revealed one after the other, but conventionally trains a single model without task-specific
  adaptation. This work introduces an online meta-learning setting, which merges ideas
  from both paradigms to better capture the spirit and practice of continual lifelong
  learning. We propose the follow the meta leader (FTML) algorithm which extends the
  MAML algorithm to this setting. Theoretically, this work provides an O(log T) regret
  guarantee with one additional higher order smoothness assumption (in comparison
  to the standard online setting). Our experimental evaluation on three different
  large-scale problems suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
  alternatives based on traditional online learning approaches.
