abstract: 'Flow-based generative models are powerful exact likelihood models with
  efficient sampling and inference. Despite their computational efficiency, flow-based
  models generally have much worse density modeling performance compared to state-of-the-art
  autoregressive models. In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting
  design choices employed by flow-based models in prior work: the use of uniform noise
  for dequantization, the use of inexpressive affine flows, and the use of purely
  convolutional conditioning networks in coupling layers. Based on our findings, we
  propose Flow++, a new flow-based model that is now the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive
  model for unconditional density estimation on standard image benchmarks. Our work
  has begun to close the significant performance gap that has so far existed between
  autoregressive models and flow-based models.'
