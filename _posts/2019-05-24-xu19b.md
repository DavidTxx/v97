abstract: A novel Gromov-Wasserstein learning framework is proposed to jointly match
  (align) graphs and learn embedding vectors for the associated graph nodes. Using
  Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy, we measure the dissimilarity between two graphs
  and find their correspondence, according to the learned optimal transport. The node
  embeddings associated with the two graphs are learned under the guidance of the
  optimal transport, the distance of which not only reflects the topological structure
  of each graph but also yields the correspondence across the graphs. These two learning
  steps are mutually-beneficial, and are unified here by minimizing the Gromov-Wasserstein
  discrepancy with structural regularizers. This framework leads to an optimization
  problem that is solved by a proximal point method. We apply the proposed method
  to matching problems in real-world networks, and demonstrate its superior performance
  compared to alternative approaches.
