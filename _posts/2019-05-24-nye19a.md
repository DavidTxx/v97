abstract: Our goal is to build systems which write code automatically from the kinds
  of specifications humans can most easily provide, such as examples and natural language
  instruction. The key idea of this work is that a flexible combination of pattern
  recognition and explicit reasoning can be used to solve these complex programming
  problems. We propose a method for dynamically integrating these types of information.
  Our novel intermediate representation and training algorithm allow a program synthesis
  system to learn, without direct supervision, when to rely on pattern recognition
  and when to perform symbolic search. Our model matches the memorization and generalization
  performance of neural synthesis and symbolic search, respectively, and achieves
  state-of-the-art performance on a dataset of simple English description-to-code
  programming problems.
