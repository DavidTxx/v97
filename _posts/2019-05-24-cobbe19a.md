abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of overfitting in deep reinforcement
  learning. Among the most common benchmarks in RL, it is customary to use the same
  environments for both training and testing. This practice offers relatively little
  insight into an agentâ€™s ability to generalize. We address this issue by using procedurally
  generated environments to construct distinct training and test sets. Most notably,
  we introduce a new environment called CoinRun, designed as a benchmark for generalization
  in RL. Using CoinRun, we find that agents overfit to surprisingly large training
  sets. We then show that deeper convolutional architectures improve generalization,
  as do methods traditionally found in supervised learning, including L2 regularization,
  dropout, data augmentation and batch normalization.
