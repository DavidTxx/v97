abstract: 'Training neural networks under a strict Lipschitz constraint is useful
  for provable adversarial robustness, generalization bounds, interpretable gradients,
  and Wasserstein distance estimation. By the composition property of Lipschitz functions,
  it suffices to ensure that each individual affine transformation or nonlinear activation
  is 1-Lipschitz. The challenge is to do this while maintaining the expressive power.
  We identify a necessary property for such an architecture: each of the layers must
  preserve the gradient norm during backpropagation. Based on this, we propose to
  combine a gradient norm preserving activation function, GroupSort, with norm-constrained
  weight matrices. We show that norm-constrained GroupSort architectures are universal
  Lipschitz function approximators. Empirically, we show that norm-constrained GroupSort
  networks achieve tighter estimates of Wasserstein distance than their ReLU counterparts
  and can achieve provable adversarial robustness guarantees with little cost to accuracy.'
