abstract: An important property for lifelong-learning agents is the ability to combine
  existing skills to solve new unseen tasks. In general, however, it is unclear how
  to compose existing skills in a principled manner. Under the assumption of deterministic
  dynamics, we prove that optimal value function composition can be achieved in entropy-regularised
  reinforcement learning (RL), and extend this result to the standard RL setting.
  Composition is demonstrated in a high-dimensional video game, where an agent with
  an existing library of skills is immediately able to solve new tasks without the
  need for further learning.
