abstract: We propose a neural hybrid model consisting of a linear model defined on
  a set of features computed by a deep, invertible transformation (i.e. a normalizing
  flow). An attractive property of our model is that both p(features), the density
  of the features, and p(targets|features), the predictive distribution, can be computed
  exactly in a single feed-forward pass. We show that our hybrid model, despite the
  invertibility constraints, achieves similar accuracy to purely predictive models.
  Yet the generative component remains a good model of the input features despite
  the hybrid optimization objective. This offers additional capabilities such as detection
  of out-of-distribution inputs and enabling semi-supervised learning. The availability
  of the exact joint density p(targets, features) also allows us to compute many quantities
  readily, making our hybrid model a useful building block for downstream applications
  of probabilistic deep learning.
