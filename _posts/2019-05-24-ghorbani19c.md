abstract: 'As data becomes the fuel driving technological and economic growth, a fundamental
  challenge is how to quantify the value of data in algorithmic predictions and decisions.
  For example, in healthcare and consumer markets, it has been suggested that individuals
  should be compensated for the data that they generate, but it is not clear what
  is an equitable valuation for individual data. In this work, we develop a principled
  framework to address data valuation in the context of supervised machine learning.
  Given a learning algorithm trained on $n$ data points to produce a predictor, we
  propose data Shapley as a metric to quantify the value of each training datum to
  the predictor performance. Data Shapley uniquely satisfies several natural properties
  of equitable data valuation. We develop Monte Carlo and gradient-based methods to
  efficiently estimate data Shapley values in practical settings where complex learning
  algorithms, including neural networks, are trained on large datasets. In addition
  to being equitable, extensive experiments across biomedical, image and synthetic
  data demonstrate that data Shapley has several other benefits: 1) it is more powerful
  than the popular leave-one-out or leverage score in providing insight on what data
  is more valuable for a given learning task; 2) low Shapley value data effectively
  capture outliers and corruptions; 3) high Shapley value data inform what type of
  new data to acquire to improve the predictor.'
