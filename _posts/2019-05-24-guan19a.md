abstract: We define a unified information-based measure to provide quantitative explanations
  on how intermediate layers of deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) models leverage
  information of input words. Our method advances existing explanation methods by
  addressing issues in coherency and generality. Explanations generated by using our
  method are consistent and faithful across different timestamps, layers, and models.
  We show how our method can be applied to four widely used models in NLP and explain
  their performances on three real-world benchmark datasets.
