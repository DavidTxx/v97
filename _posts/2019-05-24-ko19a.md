abstract: The vulnerability to adversarial attacks has been a critical issue for deep
  neural networks. Addressing this issue requires a reliable way to evaluate the robustness
  of a network. Recently, several methods have been developed to compute robustness
  quantification for neural networks, namely, certified lower bounds of the minimum
  adversarial perturbation. Such methods, however, were devised for feed-forward networks,
  e.g. multi-layer perceptron or convolutional networks. It remains an open problem
  to quantify robustness for recurrent networks, especially LSTM and GRU. For such
  networks, there exist additional challenges in computing the robustness quantification,
  such as handling the inputs at multiple steps and the interaction between gates
  and states. In this work, we propose POPQORN (Propagated-output Quantified Robustness
  for RNNs), a general algorithm to quantify robustness of RNNs, including vanilla
  RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs. We demonstrate its effectiveness on different network architectures
  and show that the robustness quantification on individual steps can lead to new
  insights.
