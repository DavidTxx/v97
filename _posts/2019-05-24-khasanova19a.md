abstract: Due to their wide field of view, omnidirectional cameras are frequently
  used by autonomous vehicles, drones and robots for navigation and other computer
  vision tasks. The images captured by such cameras, are often analyzed and classified
  with techniques designed for planar images that unfortunately fail to properly handle
  the native geometry of such images and therefore results in suboptimal performance.
  In this paper we aim at improving popular deep convolutional neural networks so
  that they can properly take into account the specific properties of omnidirectional
  data. In particular we propose an algorithm that adapts convolutional layers, which
  often serve as a core building block of a CNN, to the properties of omnidirectional
  images. Thus, our filters have a shape and size that adapt to the location on the
  omnidirectional image. We show that our method is not limited to spherical surfaces
  and is able to incorporate the knowledge about any kind of projective geometry inside
  the deep learning network. As depicted by our experiments, our method outperforms
  the existing deep neural network techniques for omnidirectional image classification
  and compression tasks.
