abstract: Recent models of emotion recognition strongly rely on supervised deep learning
  solutions for the distinction of general emotion expressions. However, they are
  not reliable when recognizing online and personalized facial expressions, e.g.,
  for person-specific affective understanding. In this paper, we present a neural
  model based on a conditional adversarial autoencoder to learn how to represent and
  edit general emotion expressions. We then propose Grow-When-Required networks as
  personalized affective memories to learn individualized aspects of emotional expressions.
  Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on emotion recognition when evaluated
  on in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, our experiments include ablation studies and
  neural visualizations in order to explain the behavior of our model.
