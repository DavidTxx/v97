abstract: This paper is concerned with various Mallows ranking models. We study the
  statistical properties of the MLE of Mallowsâ€™ $\phi$ model. We also make connections
  of various Mallows ranking models, encompassing recent progress in mathematics.
  Motivated by the infinite top-$t$ ranking model, we propose an algorithm to select
  the model size $t$ automatically. The key idea relies on the renewal property of
  such an infinite random permutation. Our algorithm shows good performance on several
  data sets.
