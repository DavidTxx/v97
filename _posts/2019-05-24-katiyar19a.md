abstract: 'Consider jointly Gaussian random variables whose conditional independence
  structure is specified by a graphical model. If we observe realizations of the variables,
  we can compute the covariance matrix, and it is well known that the support of the
  inverse covariance matrix corresponds to the edges of the graphical model. Instead,
  suppose we only have noisy observations. If the noise at each node is independent,
  we can compute the sum of the covariance matrix and an unknown diagonal. The inverse
  of this sum is (in general) dense. We ask: can the original independence structure
  be recovered? We address this question for tree structured graphical models. We
  prove that this problem is unidentifiable, but show that this unidentifiability
  is limited to a small class of candidate trees. We further present additional constraints
  under which the problem is identifiable. Finally, we provide an O(n^3) algorithm
  to find this equivalence class of trees.'
