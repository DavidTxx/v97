abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) can model complex marginal densities as well
  as complex mappings. Non-Gaussian marginals are essential for modelling real-world
  data, and can be generated from the DGP by incorporating uncorrelated variables
  to the model. Previous work in the DGP model has introduced noise additively, and
  used variational inference with a combination of sparse Gaussian processes and mean-field
  Gaussians for the approximate posterior. Additive noise attenuates the signal, and
  the Gaussian form of variational distribution may lead to an inaccurate posterior.
  We instead incorporate noisy variables as latent covariates, and propose a novel
  importance-weighted objective, which leverages analytic results and provides a mechanism
  to trade off computation for improved accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the
  importance-weighted objective works well in practice and consistently outperforms
  classical variational inference, especially for deeper models.
