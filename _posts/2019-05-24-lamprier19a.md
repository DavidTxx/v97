abstract: Many works have been proposed in the literature to capture the dynamics
  of diffusion in networks. While some of them define graphical Markovian models to
  extract temporal relationships between node infections in networks, others consider
  diffusion episodes as sequences of infections via recurrent neural models. In this
  paper we propose a model at the crossroads of these two extremes, which embeds the
  history of diffusion in infected nodes as hidden continuous states. Depending on
  the trajectory followed by the content before reaching a given node, the distribution
  of influence probabilities may vary. However, content trajectories are usually hidden
  in the data, which induces challenging learning problems. We propose a topological
  recurrent neural model which exhibits good experimental performances for diffusion
  modeling and prediction.
