abstract: Modern convolutional networks are not shift-invariant, as small input shifts
  or translations can cause drastic changes in the output. Commonly used downsampling
  methods, such as max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average-pooling, ignore the
  sampling theorem. The well-known signal processing fix is anti-aliasing by low-pass
  filtering before downsampling. However, simply inserting this module into deep networks
  leads to performance degradation; as a result, it is seldomly used today. We show
  that when integrated correctly, it is compatible with existing architectural components,
  such as max-pooling. The technique is general and can be incorporated across layer
  types and applications, such as image classification and conditional image generation.
  In addition to increased shift-invariance, we also observe, surprisingly, that anti-aliasing
  boosts accuracy in ImageNet classification, across several commonly-used architectures.
  This indicates that anti-aliasing serves as effective regularization. Our results
  demonstrate that this classical signal processing technique has been undeservingly
  overlooked in modern deep networks.
