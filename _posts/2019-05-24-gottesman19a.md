abstract: We consider a model-based approach to perform batch off-policy evaluation
  in reinforcement learning. Our method takes a mixture-of-experts approach to combine
  parametric and non-parametric models of the environment such that the final value
  estimate has the least expected error. We do so by first estimating the local accuracy
  of each model and then using a planner to select which model to use at every time
  step as to minimize the return error estimate along entire trajectories. Across
  a variety of domains, our mixture-based approach outperforms the individual models
  alone as well as state-of-the-art importance sampling-based estimators.
