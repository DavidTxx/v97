abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning from sparse and underspecified rewards,
  where an agent receives a complex input, such as a natural language instruction,
  and needs to generate a complex response, such as an action sequence, while only
  receiving binary success-failure feedback. Such success-failure rewards are often
  underspecified: they do not distinguish between purposeful and accidental success.
  Generalization from underspecified rewards hinges on discounting spurious trajectories
  that attain accidental success, while learning from sparse feedback requires effective
  exploration. We address exploration by using a mode covering direction of KL divergence
  to collect a diverse set of successful trajectories, followed by a mode seeking
  KL divergence to train a robust policy. We propose Meta Reward Learning (MeRL) to
  construct an auxiliary reward function that provides more refined feedback for learning.
  The parameters of the auxiliary reward function are optimized with respect to the
  validation performance of a trained policy. The MeRL approach outperforms an alternative
  method for reward learning based on Bayesian Optimization, and achieves the state-of-the-art
  on weakly-supervised semantic parsing. It improves previous work by 1.2% and 2.4%
  on WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL datasets respectively.'
