abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental building block in various machine
  learning algorithms. When the matrix comes from a large dataset, the multiplication
  can be split into multiple tasks which calculate the multiplication of submatrices
  on different nodes. As some nodes may be stragglers, coding schemes have been proposed
  to tolerate stragglers in such distributed matrix multiplication. However, existing
  coding schemes typically split the matrices in only one or two dimensions, limiting
  their capabilities to handle large-scale matrix multiplication. Three-dimensional
  coding, however, does not have any code construction that achieves the optimal number
  of tasks required for decoding, with the best result achieved by entangled polynomial
  (EP) codes. In this paper, we propose dual entangled polynomial (DEP) codes that
  require around 25% fewer tasks than EP codes by executing two matrix multiplications
  on each task. With experiments in a real cloud environment, we show that DEP codes
  can also save the decoding overhead and memory consumption of tasks.
