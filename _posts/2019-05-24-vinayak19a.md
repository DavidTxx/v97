abstract: Consider a setting with $N$ independent individuals, each with an unknown
  parameter, $p_i \in [0, 1]$ drawn from some unknown distribution $P^\star$. After
  observing the outcomes of $t$ independent Bernoulli trials, i.e., $X_i \sim \text{Binomial}(t,
  p_i)$ per individual, our objective is to accurately estimate $P^\star$ in the sparse
  regime, namely when $t \ll N$. This problem arises in numerous domains, including
  the social sciences, psychology, health-care, and biology, where the size of the
  population under study is usually large yet the number of observations per individual
  is often limited. Our main result shows that, in this sparse regime where $t \ll
  N$, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is both statistically minimax optimal
  and efficiently computable. Precisely, for sufficiently large $N$, the MLE achieves
  the information theoretic optimal error bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{t})$ for
  $t < c\log{N}$, with regards to the earth moverâ€™s distance (between the estimated
  and true distributions). More generally, in an exponentially large interval of $t$
  beyond $c \log{N}$, the MLE achieves the minimax error bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t\log
  N}})$. In contrast, regardless of how large $N$ is, the naive "plug-in" estimator
  for this problem only achieves the sub-optimal error of $\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$.
  Empirically, we also demonstrate the MLE performs well on both synthetic as well
  as real datasets.
