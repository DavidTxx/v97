abstract: Model fusion is a fundamental problem in collec-tive machine learning (ML)
  where independentexperts with heterogeneous learning architecturesare required to
  combine expertise to improve pre-dictive performance. This is particularly chal-lenging
  in information-sensitive domains whereexperts do not have access to each otherâ€™s
  internalarchitecture and local data. This paper presentsthe first collective model
  fusion framework formultiple experts with heterogeneous black-box ar-chitectures.
  The proposed method will enable thisby addressing the key issues of how black-boxexperts
  interact to understand the predictive be-haviors of one another; how these understandingscan
  be represented and shared efficiently amongthemselves; and how the shared understandingscan
  be combined to generate high-quality consen-sus prediction. The performance of the
  resultingframework is analyzed theoretically and demon-strated empirically on several
  datasets.
