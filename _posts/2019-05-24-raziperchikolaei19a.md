abstract: We propose and analyze a block coordinate descent proximal algorithm (BCD-prox)
  for simultaneous filtering and parameter estimation of ODE models. As we show on
  ODE systems with up to d=40 dimensions, as compared to state-of-the-art methods,
  BCD-prox exhibits increased robustness (to noise, parameter initialization, and
  hyperparameters), decreased training times, and improved accuracy of both filtered
  states and estimated parameters. We show how BCD-prox can be used with multistep
  numerical discretizations, and we establish convergence of BCD-prox under hypotheses
  that include real systems of interest.
