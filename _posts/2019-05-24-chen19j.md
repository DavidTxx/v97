abstract: The von Neumann graph entropy (VNGE) facilitates measurement of information
  divergence and distance between graphs in a graph sequence. It has been successfully
  applied to various learning tasks driven by network-based data. While effective,
  VNGE is computationally demanding as it requires the full eigenspectrum of the graph
  Laplacian matrix. In this paper, we propose a new computational framework, Fast
  Incremental von Neumann Graph EntRopy (FINGER), which approaches VNGE with a performance
  guarantee. FINGER reduces the cubic complexity of VNGE to linear complexity in the
  number of nodes and edges, and thus enables online computation based on incremental
  graph changes. We also show asymptotic equivalence of FINGER to the exact VNGE,
  and derive its approximation error bounds. Based on FINGER, we propose efficient
  algorithms for computing Jensen-Shannon distance between graphs. Our experimental
  results on different random graph models demonstrate the computational efficiency
  and the asymptotic equivalence of FINGER. In addition, we apply FINGER to two real-world
  applications and one synthesized anomaly detection dataset, and corroborate its
  superior performance over seven baseline graph similarity methods.
