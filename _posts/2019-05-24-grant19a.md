abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively placing sensors along an interval
  to detect stochastically-generated events. We present a new formulation of the problem
  as a continuum-armed bandit problem with feedback in the form of partial observations
  of realisations of an inhomogeneous Poisson process. We design a solution method
  by combining Thompson sampling with nonparametric inference via increasingly granular
  Bayesian histograms and derive an $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ bound on the Bayesian regret
  in $T$ rounds. This is coupled with the design of an efficent optimisation approach
  to select actions in polynomial time. In simulations we demonstrate our approach
  to have substantially lower and less variable regret than competitor algorithms.
