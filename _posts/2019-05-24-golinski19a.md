abstract: Current approaches to amortizing Bayesian inference focus solely on approximating
  the posterior distribution. Typically, this approximation is, in turn, used to calculate
  expectations for one or more target functions{â€”}a computational pipeline which is
  inefficient when the target function(s) are known upfront. In this paper, we address
  this inefficiency by introducing AMCI, a method for amortizing Monte Carlo integration
  directly. AMCI operates similarly to amortized inference but produces three distinct
  amortized proposals, each tailored to a different component of the overall expectation
  calculation. At runtime, samples are produced separately from each amortized proposal,
  before being combined to an overall estimate of the expectation. We show that while
  existing approaches are fundamentally limited in the level of accuracy they can
  achieve, AMCI can theoretically produce arbitrarily small errors for any integrable
  target function using only a single sample from each proposal at runtime. We further
  show that it is able to empirically outperform the theoretically optimal selfnormalized
  importance sampler on a number of example problems. Furthermore, AMCI allows not
  only for amortizing over datasets but also amortizing over target functions.
