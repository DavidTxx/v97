abstract: 'One widely-studied model of <em>teaching</em> calls for a teacher to provide
  the minimal set of labeled examples that uniquely specifies a target concept. The
  assumption is that the teacher knows the learner’s hypothesis class, which is often
  not true of real-life teaching scenarios. We consider the problem of teaching a
  learner whose representation and hypothesis class are unknown—that is, the learner
  is a black box. We show that a teacher who does not interact with the learner can
  do no better than providing random examples. We then prove, however, that with interaction,
  a teacher can efficiently find a set of teaching examples that is a provably good
  approximation to the optimal set. As an illustration, we show how this scheme can
  be used to <em>shrink</em> training sets for any family of classifiers: that is,
  to find an approximately-minimal subset of training instances that yields the same
  classifier as the entire set.'
