abstract: Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the
  discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations
  such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector
  multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm.
  We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary,
  what structural prior they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically
  learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization
  of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce
  a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing
  a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an
  efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the
  $O(N \log N)$ Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions $N$
  up to $1024$. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement
  of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible
  transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network,
  our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10
  by 3.9 points—the first time a structured approach has done so—with 4X faster inference
  speed and 40X fewer parameters.
