abstract: 'Addressing catastrophic forgetting is one of the key challenges in continual
  learning where machine learning systems are trained with sequential or streaming
  tasks. Despite recent remarkable progress in state-of-the-art deep learning, deep
  neural networks (DNNs) are still plagued with the catastrophic forgetting problem.
  This paper presents a conceptually simple yet general and effective framework for
  handling catastrophic forgetting in continual learning with DNNs. The proposed method
  consists of two components: a neural structure optimization component and a parameter
  learning and/or fine-tuning component. By separating the explicit neural structure
  learning and the parameter estimation, not only is the proposed method capable of
  evolving neural structures in an intuitively meaningful way, but also shows strong
  capabilities of alleviating catastrophic forgetting in experiments. Furthermore,
  the proposed method outperforms all other baselines on the permuted MNIST dataset,
  the split CIFAR100 dataset and the Visual Domain Decathlon dataset in continual
  learning setting.'
