abstract: 'One of the central goals of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is to learn
  long-term dependencies in sequential data. Nevertheless, the most popular training
  method, Truncated Backpropagation through Time (TBPTT), categorically forbids learning
  dependencies beyond the truncation horizon. In contrast, the online training algorithm
  Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) provides untruncated gradients, with the disadvantage
  of impractically large computational costs. Recently published approaches reduce
  these costs by providing noisy approximations of RTRL. We present a new approximation
  algorithm of RTRL, Optimal Kronecker-Sum Approximation (OK). We prove that OK is
  optimal for a class of approximations of RTRL, which includes all approaches published
  so far. Additionally, we show that OK has empirically negligible noise: Unlike previous
  algorithms it matches TBPTT in a real world task (character-level Penn TreeBank)
  and can exploit online parameter updates to outperform TBPTT in a synthetic string
  memorization task. Code available at GitHub.'
