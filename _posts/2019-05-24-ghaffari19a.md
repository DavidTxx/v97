abstract: 'Clustering large-scale networks is a central topic in unsupervised learning
  with many applications in machine learning and data mining. A classic approach to
  cluster a network is to identify regions of high edge density, which in the literature
  is captured by two fundamental problems: the densest subgraph and the $k$-core decomposition
  problems. We design massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithms for these problems
  that are considerably faster than prior work. In the case of $k$-core decomposition,
  our work improves exponentially on the algorithm provided by Esfandiari et al. (ICML’18).
  Compared to the prior work on densest subgraph presented by Bahmani et al. (VLDB’12,
  ’14), our result requires quadratically fewer MPC rounds. We complement our analysis
  with an experimental scalability analysis of our techniques.'
