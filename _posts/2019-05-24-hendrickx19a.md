abstract: We consider the problem of learning the qualities of a collection of items
  by performing noisy comparisons among them. Following the standard paradigm, we
  assume there is a fixed “comparison graph” and every neighboring pair of items in
  this graph is compared k times according to the Bradley-Terry-Luce model (where
  the probability than an item wins a comparison is proportional the item quality).
  We are interested in how the relative error in quality estimation scales with the
  comparison graph in the regime where k is large. We show that, asymptotically, the
  relevant graph-theoretic quantity is the square root of the resistance of the comparison
  graph. Specifically, we provide an algorithm with relative error decay that scales
  with the square root of the graph resistance, and provide a lower bound showing
  that (up to log factors) a better scaling is impossible. The performance guarantee
  of our algorithm, both in terms of the graph and the skewness of the item quality
  distribution, significantly outperforms earlier results.
