abstract: Knowledge distillation deals with the problem of training a smaller model
  (<em>Student</em>) from a high capacity source model (<em>Teacher</em>) so as to
  retain most of its performance. Existing approaches use either the training data
  or meta-data extracted from it in order to train the <em>Student</em>. However,
  accessing the dataset on which the <em>Teacher</em> has been trained may not always
  be feasible if the dataset is very large or it poses privacy or safety concerns
  (e.g., bio-metric or medical data). Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel data-free
  method to train the <em>Student</em> from the <em>Teacher</em>. Without even using
  any meta-data, we synthesize the <em>Data Impressions</em> from the complex <em>Teacher</em>
  model and utilize these as surrogates for the original training data samples to
  transfer its learning to <em>Student</em> via knowledge distillation. We, therefore,
  dub our method â€œZero-Shot Knowledge Distillation" and demonstrate that our framework
  results in competitive generalization performance as achieved by distillation using
  the actual training data samples on multiple benchmark datasets.
