abstract: Many real-life decision making situations allow further relevant information
  to be acquired at a specific cost, for example, in assessing the health status of
  a patient we may decide to take additional measurements such as diagnostic tests
  or imaging scans before making a final assessment. Acquiring more relevant information
  enables better decision making, but may be costly. How can we trade off the desire
  to make good decisions by acquiring further information with the cost of performing
  that acquisition? To this end, we propose a principled framework, named <em>EDDI</em>
  (Efficient Dynamic Discovery of high-value Information), based on the theory of
  Bayesian experimental design. In EDDI, we propose a novel <em>partial variational
  autoencoder</em> (Partial VAE) to predict missing data entries problematically given
  any subset of the observed ones, and combine it with an acquisition function that
  maximizes expected information gain on a set of target variables. We show cost reduction
  at the same decision quality and improved decision quality at the same cost in multiple
  machine learning benchmarks and two real-world health-care applications.
