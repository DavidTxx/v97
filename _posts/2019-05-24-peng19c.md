abstract: Deep networks have achieved impressive performance in various domains, but
  their applications are largely limited by the prohibitive computational overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely collaborative channel pruning
  (CCP), to reduce the computational overhead with negligible performance degradation.
  The joint impact of pruned/preserved channels on the loss function is quantitatively
  analyzed, and such interchannel dependency is exploited to determine which channels
  to be pruned. The channel selection problem is then reformulated as a constrained
  0-1 quadratic optimization problem, and the Hessian matrix, which is essential in
  constructing the above optimization, can be efficiently approximated. Empirical
  evaluation on two benchmark data sets indicates that our proposed CCP algorithm
  achieves higher classification accuracy with similar computational complexity than
  other stateof-the-art channel pruning algorithms
