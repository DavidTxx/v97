abstract: Lossy compression algorithms are typically designed and analyzed through
  the lens of Shannonâ€™s rate-distortion theory, where the goal is to achieve the lowest
  possible distortion (e.g., low MSE or high SSIM) at any given bit rate. However,
  in recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that "low distortion" is not
  a synonym for "high perceptual quality", and in fact optimization of one often comes
  at the expense of the other. In light of this understanding, it is natural to seek
  for a generalization of rate-distortion theory which takes perceptual quality into
  account. In this paper, we adopt the mathematical definition of perceptual quality
  recently proposed by Blau & Michaeli (2018), and use it to study the three-way tradeoff
  between rate, distortion, and perception. We show that restricting the perceptual
  quality to be high, generally leads to an elevation of the rate-distortion curve,
  thus necessitating a sacrifice in either rate or distortion. We prove several fundamental
  properties of this triple-tradeoff, calculate it in closed form for a Bernoulli
  source, and illustrate it visually on a toy MNIST example.
