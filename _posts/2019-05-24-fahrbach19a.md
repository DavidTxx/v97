abstract: Submodular maximization is a general optimization problem with a wide range
  of applications in machine learning (e.g., active learning, clustering, and feature
  selection). In large-scale optimization, the parallel running time of an algorithm
  is governed by its adaptivity, which measures the number of sequential rounds needed
  if the algorithm can execute polynomially-many independent oracle queries in parallel.
  While low adaptivity is ideal, it is not sufficient for an algorithm to be efficient
  in practiceâ€”there are many applications of distributed submodular optimization where
  the number of function evaluations becomes prohibitively expensive. Motivated by
  these applications, we study the adaptivity and query complexity of submodular maximization.
  In this paper, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing
  a non-monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint $k$ that
  runs in $O(\log(n))$ adaptive rounds and makes $O(n \log(k))$ oracle queries in
  expectation. In our empirical study, we use three real-world applications to compare
  our algorithm with several benchmarks for non-monotone submodular maximization.
  The results demonstrate that our algorithm finds competitive solutions using significantly
  fewer rounds and queries.
