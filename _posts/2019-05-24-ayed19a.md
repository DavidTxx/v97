abstract: 'Bayesian nonparametric approaches, in particular the Pitman-Yor process
  and the associated two-parameter Chinese Restaurant process, have been successfully
  used in applications where the data exhibit a power-law behavior. Examples include
  natural language processing, natural images or networks. There is also growing empirical
  evidence suggesting that some datasets exhibit a two-regime power-law behavior:
  one regime for small frequencies, and a second regime, with a different exponent,
  for high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a class of completely random measures
  which are doubly regularly-varying. Contrary to the Pitman-Yor process, we show
  that when completely random measures in this class are normalized to obtain random
  probability measures and associated random partitions, such partitions exhibit a
  double power-law behavior. We present two general constructions and discuss in particular
  two models within this class: the beta prime process (Broderick et al. (2015, 2018)
  and a novel process called generalized BFRY process. We derive efficient Markov
  chain Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate the parameters of these models. Finally,
  we show that the proposed models provide a better fit than the Pitman-Yor process
  on various datasets.'
