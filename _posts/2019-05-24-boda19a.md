abstract: While the objective in traditional multi-armed bandit problems is to find
  the arm with the highest mean, in many settings, finding an arm that best captures
  information about other arms is of interest. This objective, however, requires learning
  the underlying correlation structure and not just the means. Sensors placement for
  industrial surveillance and cellular network monitoring are a few applications,
  where the underlying correlation structure plays an important role. Motivated by
  such applications, we formulate the correlated bandit problem, where the objective
  is to find the arm with the lowest mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating all the
  arms. To this end, we derive first an MSE estimator based on sample variances/covariances
  and show that our estimator exponentially concentrates around the true MSE. Under
  a best-arm identification framework, we propose a successive rejects type algorithm
  and provide bounds on the probability of error in identifying the best arm. Using
  minimax theory, we also derive fundamental performance limits for the correlated
  bandit problem.
