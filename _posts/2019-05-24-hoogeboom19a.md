abstract: 'Generative flows are attractive because they admit exact likelihood optimization
  and efficient image synthesis. Recently, Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) demonstrated with
  Glow that generative flows are capable of generating high quality images. We generalize
  the 1 {\texttimes} 1 convolutions proposed in Glow to invertible d {\texttimes}
  d convolutions, which are more flexible since they operate on both channel and spatial
  axes. We propose two methods to produce invertible convolutions, that have receptive
  fields identical to standard convolutions: Emerging convolutions are obtained by
  chaining specific autoregressive convolutions, and periodic convolutions are decoupled
  in the frequency domain. Our experiments show that the flexibility of d {\texttimes}
  d convolutions significantly improves the performance of generative flow models
  on galaxy images, CIFAR10 and ImageNet.'
