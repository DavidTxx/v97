abstract: In this paper, we formulate a novel problem of learning to select a set
  of items maximizing the quality of their ordered list, where the order is predefined
  by some explicit rule. Unlike the classic information retrieval problem, in our
  setting, the predefined order of items in the list may not correspond to their quality
  in general. For example, this is a dominant scenario in personalized news and social
  media feeds, where items are ordered by publication time in a user interface. We
  propose new theoretically grounded algorithms based on direct optimization of the
  resulting list quality. Our offline and online experiments with a large-scale product
  search engine demonstrate the overwhelming advantage of our methods over the baselines
  in terms of all key quality metrics.
