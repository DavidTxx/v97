abstract: The Softmax function on top of a final linear layer is the de facto method
  to output probability distributions in neural networks. In many applications such
  as language models or text generation, this model has to produce distributions over
  large output vocabularies. Recently, this has been shown to have limited representational
  capacity due to its connection with the rank bottleneck in matrix factorization.
  However, little is known about the limitations of Linear-Softmax for quantities
  of practical interest such as cross entropy or mode estimation, a direction that
  we explore here. As an efficient and effective solution to alleviate this issue,
  we propose to learn parametric monotonic functions on top of the logits. We theoretically
  investigate the rank increasing capabilities of such monotonic functions. Empirically,
  our method improves in two different quality metrics over the traditional Linear-Softmax
  layer in synthetic and real language model experiments, adding little time or memory
  overhead, while being comparable to the more computationally expensive mixture of
  Softmaxes.
