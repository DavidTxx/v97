abstract: By building upon the recent theory that established the connection between
  implicit generative modeling (IGM) and optimal transport, in this study, we propose
  a novel parameter-free algorithm for learning the underlying distributions of complicated
  datasets and sampling from them. The proposed algorithm is based on a functional
  optimization problem, which aims at finding a measure that is close to the data
  distribution as much as possible and also expressive enough for generative modeling
  purposes. We formulate the problem as a gradient flow in the space of probability
  measures. The connections between gradient flows and stochastic differential equations
  let us develop a computationally efficient algorithm for solving the optimization
  problem. We provide formal theoretical analysis where we prove finite-time error
  guarantees for the proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
  algorithm is the first nonparametric IGM algorithm with explicit theoretical guarantees.
  Our experimental results support our theory and show that our algorithm is able
  to successfully capture the structure of different types of data distributions.
