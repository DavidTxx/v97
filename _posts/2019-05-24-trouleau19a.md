abstract: Multivariate Hawkes processes (MHP) are widely used in a variety of fields
  to model the occurrence of discrete events. Prior work on learning MHPs has only
  focused on inference in the presence of perfect traces without noise. We address
  the problem of learning the causal structure of MHPs when observations are subject
  to an unknown delay. In particular, we introduce the so-called synchronization noise,
  where the stream of events generated by each dimension is subject to a random and
  unknown time shift. We characterize the robustness of the classic maximum likelihood
  estimator to synchronization noise, and we introduce a new approach for learning
  the causal structure in the presence of noise. Our experimental results show that
  our approach accurately recovers the causal structure of MHPs for a wide range of
  noise levels, and significantly outperforms classic estimation methods.
