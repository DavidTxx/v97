abstract: We propose a bandit algorithm that explores by randomizing its history of
  rewards. Specifically, it pulls the arm with the highest mean reward in a non-parametric
  bootstrap sample of its history with pseudo rewards. We design the pseudo rewards
  such that the bootstrap mean is optimistic with a sufficiently high probability.
  We call our algorithm Giro, which stands for garbage in, reward out. We analyze
  Giro in a Bernoulli bandit and derive a $O(K \Delta^{-1} \log n)$ bound on its $n$-round
  regret, where $\Delta$ is the difference in the expected rewards of the optimal
  and the best suboptimal arms, and $K$ is the number of arms. The main advantage
  of our exploration design is that it easily generalizes to structured problems.
  To show this, we propose contextual Giro with an arbitrary reward generalization
  model. We evaluate Giro and its contextual variant on multiple synthetic and real-world
  problems, and observe that it performs well.
