abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for quantifying the semantic similarity
  between two groups of embeddings. We formulate the task of semantic similarity as
  a model comparison task in which we contrast a generative model which jointly models
  two sentences versus one that does not. We illustrate how this framework can be
  used for the Semantic Textual Similarity tasks using clear assumptions about how
  the embeddings of words are generated. We apply model comparison that utilises information
  criteria to address some of the shortcomings of Bayesian model comparison, whilst
  still penalising model complexity. We achieve competitive results by applying the
  proposed framework with an appropriate choice of likelihood on the STS datasets.
