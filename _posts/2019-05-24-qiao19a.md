abstract: Machine learning (ML) training algorithms often possess an inherent self-correcting
  behavior due to their iterative- convergent nature. Recent systems exploit this
  property to achieve adaptability and efficiency in unreliable computing environments
  by relaxing the consistency of execution and allowing calculation errors to be self-corrected
  during training. However, the behavior of such systems are only well understood
  for specific types of calculation errors, such as those caused by staleness, reduced
  precision, or asynchronicity, and for specific algorithms, such as stochastic gradient
  descent. In this paper, we develop a general framework to quantify the effects of
  calculation errors on iterative-convergent algorithms. We then use this framework
  to derive a worst-case upper bound on the cost of arbitrary perturbations to model
  parameters during training and to design new strategies for checkpoint-based fault
  tolerance. Our system, SCAR, can reduce the cost of partial failures by 78%{â€“}95%
  when compared with traditional checkpoint-based fault tolerance across a variety
  of ML models and training algorithms, providing near-optimal performance in recovering
  from failures.
