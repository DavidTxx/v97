abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Deep RL in learning control policies from
  raw pixels, the resulting models do not generalize. We demonstrate that a trained
  agent fails completely when facing small visual changes, and that fine-tuning—the
  common transfer learning paradigm—fails to adapt to these changes, to the extent
  that it is faster to re-train the model from scratch. We show that by separating
  the visual transfer task from the control policy we achieve substantially better
  sample efficiency and transfer behavior, allowing an agent trained on the source
  task to transfer well to the target tasks. The visual mapping from the target to
  the source domain is performed using unaligned GANs, resulting in a control policy
  that can be further improved using imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations.
  We demonstrate the approach on synthetic visual variants of the Breakout game, as
  well as on transfer between subsequent levels of Road Fighter, a Nintendo car-driving
  game. A visualization of our approach can be seen in \url{https://youtu.be/4mnkzYyXMn4}
