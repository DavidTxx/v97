abstract: 'Many modern learning tasks involve fitting nonlinear models which are trained
  in an overparameterized regime where the parameters of the model exceed the size
  of the training dataset. Due to this overparameterization, the training loss may
  have infinitely many global minima and it is critical to understand the properties
  of the solutions found by first-order optimization schemes such as (stochastic)
  gradient descent starting from different initializations. In this paper we demonstrate
  that when the loss has certain properties over a minimally small neighborhood of
  the initial point, first order methods such as (stochastic) gradient descent have
  a few intriguing properties: (1) the iterates converge at a geometric rate to a
  global optima even when the loss is nonconvex, (2) among all global optima of the
  loss the iterates converge to one with a near minimal distance to the initial point,
  (3) the iterates take a near direct route from the initial point to this global
  optimum. As part of our proof technique, we introduce a new potential function which
  captures the tradeoff between the loss function and the distance to the initial
  point as the iterations progress. The utility of our general theory is demonstrated
  for a variety of problem domains spanning low-rank matrix recovery to shallow neural
  network training.'
