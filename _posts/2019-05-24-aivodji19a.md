abstract: Black-box explanation is the problem of explaining how a machine learning
  model – whose internal logic is hidden to the auditor and generally complex – produces
  its outcomes. Current approaches for solving this problem include model explanation,
  outcome explanation as well as model inspection. While these techniques can be beneficial
  by providing interpretability, they can be used in a negative manner to perform
  fairwashing, which we define as promoting the false perception that a machine learning
  model respects some ethical values. In particular, we demonstrate that it is possible
  to systematically rationalize decisions taken by an unfair black-box model using
  the model explanation as well as the outcome explanation approaches with a given
  fairness metric. Our solution, LaundryML, is based on a regularized rule list enumeration
  algorithm whose objective is to search for fair rule lists approximating an unfair
  black-box model. We empirically evaluate our rationalization technique on black-box
  models trained on real-world datasets and show that one can obtain rule lists with
  high fidelity to the black-box model while being considerably less unfair at the
  same time.
