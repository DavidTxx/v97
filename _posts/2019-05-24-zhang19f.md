abstract: Capturing long-range dependencies in feature representations is crucial
  for many visual recognition tasks. Despite recent successes of deep convolutional
  networks, it remains challenging to model non-local context relations between visual
  features. A promising strategy is to model the feature context by a fully-connected
  graph neural network (GNN), which augments traditional convolutional features with
  an estimated non-local context representation. However, most GNN-based approaches
  require computing a dense graph affinity matrix and hence have difficulty in scaling
  up to tackle complex real-world visual problems. In this work, we propose an efficient
  and yet flexible non-local relation representation based on a novel class of graph
  neural networks. Our key idea is to introduce a latent space to reduce the complexity
  of graph, which allows us to use a low-rank representation for the graph affinity
  matrix and to achieve a linear complexity in computation. Extensive experimental
  evaluations on three major visual recognition tasks show that our method outperforms
  the prior works with a large margin while maintaining a low computation cost.
