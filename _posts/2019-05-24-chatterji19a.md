abstract: We present a generalization of the adversarial linear bandits framework,
  where the underlying losses are kernel functions (with an associated reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space) rather than linear functions. We study a version of the exponential
  weights algorithm and bound its regret in this setting. Under conditions on the
  eigen-decay of the kernel we provide a sharp characterization of the regret for
  this algorithm. When we have polynomial eigen-decay ($\mu_j \le \mathcal{O}(j^{-\beta})$),
  we find that the regret is bounded by $\mathcal{R}_n \le \mathcal{O}(n^{\beta/2(\beta-1)})$.
  While under the assumption of exponential eigen-decay ($\mu_j \le \mathcal{O}(e^{-\beta
  j })$) we get an even tighter bound on the regret $\mathcal{R}_n \le \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1/2})$.
  When the eigen-decay is polynomial we also show a <em>non-matching</em> minimax
  lower bound on the regret of $\mathcal{R}_n \ge \Omega(n^{(\beta+1)/2\beta})$ and
  a lower bound of $\mathcal{R}_n \ge \Omega(n^{1/2})$ when the decay in the eigen-values
  is exponentially fast. We also study the full information setting when the underlying
  losses are kernel functions and present an adapted exponential weights algorithm
  and a conditional gradient descent algorithm.
