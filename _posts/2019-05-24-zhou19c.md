abstract: In this paper we show that generative adversarial networks (GANs) without
  restriction on the discriminative function space commonly suffer from the problem
  that the gradient produced by the discriminator is uninformative to guide the generator.
  By contrast, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), where the discriminative function is restricted
  to 1-Lipschitz, does not suffer from such a gradient uninformativeness problem.
  We further show in the paper that the model with a compact dual form of Wasserstein
  distance, where the Lipschitz condition is relaxed, may also theoretically suffer
  from this issue. This implies the importance of Lipschitz condition and motivates
  us to study the general formulation of GANs with Lipschitz constraint, which leads
  to a new family of GANs that we call Lipschitz GANs (LGANs). We show that LGANs
  guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the optimal discriminative function as
  well as the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium. We prove that LGANs are generally
  capable of eliminating the gradient uninformativeness problem. According to our
  empirical analysis, LGANs are more stable and generate consistently higher quality
  samples compared with WGAN.
