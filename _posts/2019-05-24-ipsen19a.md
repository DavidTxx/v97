abstract: How does missing data affect our ability to learn signal structures? It
  has been shown that learning signal structure in terms of principal components is
  dependent on the ratio of sample size and dimensionality and that a critical number
  of observations is needed before learning starts (Biehl and Mietzner, 1993). Here
  we generalize this analysis to include missing data. Probabilistic principal component
  analysis is regularly used for estimating signal structures in datasets with missing
  data. Our analytic result suggest that the effect of missing data is to effectively
  reduce signal-to-noise ratio rather than - as generally believed - to reduce sample
  size. The theory predicts a phase transition in the learning curves and this is
  indeed found both in simulation data and in real datasets.
