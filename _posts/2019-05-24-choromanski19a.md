abstract: Many machine learning methods making use of Monte Carlo sampling in vector
  spaces have been shown to be improved by conditioning samples to be mutually orthogonal.
  Exact orthogonal coupling of samples is computationally intensive, hence approximate
  methods have been of great interest. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective
  of many approximate methods by considering Givens transformations, propose new approximate
  methods based on this framework, and demonstrate the Ô¨Årst statistical guarantees
  for families of approximate methods in kernel approximation. We provide extensive
  empirical evaluations with guidance for practitioners.
