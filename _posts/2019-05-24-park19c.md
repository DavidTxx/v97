abstract: 'Given a graphical model (GM), computing its partition function is the most
  essential inference task, but it is computationally intractable in general. To address
  the issue, iterative approximation algorithms exploring certain local structure/consistency
  of GM have been investigated as popular choices in practice. However, due to their
  local/iterative nature, they often output poor approximations or even do not converge,
  e.g., in low-temperature regimes (hard instances of large parameters). To overcome
  the limitation, we propose a novel approach utilizing the global spectral feature
  of GM. Our contribution is two-fold: (a) we first propose a fully polynomial-time
  approximation scheme (FPTAS) for approximating the partition function of GM associating
  with a low-rank coupling matrix; (b) for general high-rank GMs, we design a spectral
  mean-field scheme utilizing (a) as a subroutine, where it approximates a high-rank
  GM into a product of rank-1 GMs for an efficient approximation of the partition
  function. The proposed algorithm is more robust in its running time and accuracy
  than prior methods, i.e., neither suffers from the convergence issue nor depends
  on hard local structures, as demonstrated in our experiments.'
