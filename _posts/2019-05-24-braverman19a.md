abstract: We design coresets for Ordered k-Median, a generalization of classical clustering
  problems such as k-Median and k-Center. Its objective function is defined via the
  Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) paradigm of Yager (1988), where data points are
  weighted according to a predefined weight vector, but in order of their contribution
  to the objective (distance from the centers). A powerful data-reduction technique,
  called a coreset, is to summarize a point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ into a small
  (weighted) point set $X’$, such that for every set of $k$ potential centers, the
  objective value of the coreset $X’$ approximates that of $X$ within factor $1\pm
  \epsilon$. When there are multiple objectives (weights), the above standard coreset
  might have limited usefulness, whereas in a <em>simultaneous</em> coreset, the above
  approximation holds for all weights (in addition to all centers). Our main result
  is a construction of a simultaneous coreset of size $O_{\epsilon, d}(k^2 \log^2
  |X|)$ for Ordered k-Median. We validate our algorithm on a real geographical data
  set, and we find our coreset leads to a massive speedup of clustering computations,
  while maintaining high accuracy for a range of weights.
