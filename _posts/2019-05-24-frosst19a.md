abstract: 'We explore and expand the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss to measure the entanglement
  of class manifolds in representation space: i.e., how close pairs of points from
  the same class are relative to pairs of points from different classes. We demonstrate
  several use cases of the loss. As an analytical tool, it provides insights into
  the evolution of class similarity structures during learning. Surprisingly, we find
  that maximizing the entanglement of representations of different classes in the
  hidden layers is beneficial for discrimination in the final layer, possibly because
  it encourages representations to identify class-independent similarity structures.
  Maximizing the soft nearest neighbor loss in the hidden layers leads not only to
  better-calibrated estimates of uncertainty on outlier data but also marginally improved
  generalization. Data that is not from the training distribution can be recognized
  by observing that in the hidden layers, it has fewer than the normal number of neighbors
  from the predicted class.'
