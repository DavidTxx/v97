abstract: We study the problem of meta-learning through the lens of online convex
  optimization, developing a meta-algorithm bridging the gap between popular gradient-based
  meta-learning and classical regularization-based multi-task transfer methods. Our
  method is the first to simultaneously satisfy good sample efficiency guarantees
  in the convex setting, with generalization bounds that improve with task-similarity,
  while also being computationally scalable to modern deep learning architectures
  and the many-task setting. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm matches, up to
  a constant factor, a lower bound on the performance of any such parameter-transfer
  method under natural task similarity assumptions. We use experiments in both convex
  and deep learning settings to verify and demonstrate the applicability of our theory.
