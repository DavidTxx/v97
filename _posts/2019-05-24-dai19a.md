abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular paradigm for optimizing the hyperparameters
  of machine learning (ML) models due to its sample efficiency. Many ML models require
  running an iterative training procedure (e.g., stochastic gradient descent). This
  motivates the question whether information available during the training process
  (e.g., validation accuracy after each epoch) can be exploited for improving the
  epoch efficiency of BO algorithms by early-stopping model training under hyperparameter
  settings that will end up under-performing and hence eliminating unnecessary training
  epochs. This paper proposes to unify BO (specifically, Gaussian process-upper confidence
  bound (GP-UCB)) with Bayesian optimal stopping (BO-BOS) to boost the epoch efficiency
  of BO. To achieve this, while GP-UCB is sample-efficient in the number of function
  evaluations, BOS complements it with epoch efficiency for each function evaluation
  by providing a principled optimal stopping mechanism for early stopping. BO-BOS
  preserves the (asymptotic) no-regret performance of GP-UCB using our specified choice
  of BOS parameters that is amenable to an elegant interpretation in terms of the
  exploration-exploitation trade-off. We empirically evaluate the performance of BO-BOS
  and demonstrate its generality in hyperparameter optimization of ML models and two
  other interesting applications.
