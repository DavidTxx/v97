abstract: Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (Deep UDA) methods successfully leverage
  rich labeled data in a source domain to boost the performance on related but unlabeled
  data in a target domain. However, algorithm comparison is cumbersome in Deep UDA
  due to the absence of accurate and standardized model selection method, posing an
  obstacle to further advances in the field. Existing model selection methods for
  Deep UDA are either highly biased, restricted, unstable, or even controversial (requiring
  labeled target data). To this end, we propose Deep Embedded Validation (DEV), which
  embeds adapted feature representation into the validation procedure to obtain unbiased
  estimation of the target risk with bounded variance. The variance is further reduced
  by the technique of control variate. The efficacy of the method has been justified
  both theoretically and empirically.
