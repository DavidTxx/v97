abstract: 'Unsupervised model transfer has the potential to greatly improve the generalizability
  of deep models to novel domains. Yet the current literature assumes that the separation
  of target data into distinct domains is known a priori. In this paper, we propose
  the task of Domain-Agnostic Learning (DAL): How to transfer knowledge from a labeled
  source domain to unlabeled data from arbitrary target domains? To tackle this problem,
  we devise a novel Deep Adversarial Disentangled Autoencoder (DADA) capable of disentangling
  domain-specific features from class identity. We demonstrate experimentally that
  when the target domain labels are unknown, DADA leads to state-of-the-art performance
  on several image classification datasets.'
