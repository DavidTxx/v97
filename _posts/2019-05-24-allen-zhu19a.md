abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated dominating performance in
  many fields; since AlexNet, networks used in practice are going wider and deeper.
  On the theoretical side, a long line of works have been focusing on why we can train
  neural networks when there is only one hidden layer. The theory of multi-layer networks
  remains unsettled. In this work, we prove simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) can find Global Minima on the training objective of DNNs in Polynomial
  Time. We only make two assumptions: the inputs do not degenerate and the network
  is over-parameterized. The latter means the number of hidden neurons is sufficiently
  large: polynomial in L, the number of DNN layers and in n, the number of training
  samples. As concrete examples, starting from randomly initialized weights, we show
  that SGD attains 100% training accuracy in classification tasks, or minimizes regression
  loss in linear convergence speed eps Â  e^{-T}, with running time polynomial in n
  and L. Our theory applies to the widely-used but non-smooth ReLU activation, and
  to any smooth and possibly non-convex loss functions. In terms of network architectures,
  our theory at least applies to fully-connected neural networks, convolutional neural
  networks (CNN), and residual neural networks (ResNet).'
