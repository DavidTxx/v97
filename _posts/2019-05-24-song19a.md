abstract: We are concerned with obtaining well-calibrated output distributions from
  regression models. Such distributions allow us to quantify the uncertainty that
  the model has regarding the predicted target value. We introduce the novel concept
  of distribution calibration, and demonstrate its advantages over the existing definition
  of quantile calibration. We further propose a post-hoc approach to improving the
  predictions from previously trained regression models, using multi-output Gaussian
  Processes with a novel Beta link function. The proposed method is experimentally
  verified on a set of common regression models and shows improvements for both distribution-level
  and quantile-level calibration.
