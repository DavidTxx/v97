abstract: The gradient noise (GN) in the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm
  is often considered to be Gaussian in the large data regime by assuming that the
  classical central limit theorem (CLT) kicks in. This assumption is often made for
  mathematical convenience, since it enables SGD to be analyzed as a stochastic differential
  equation (SDE) driven by a Brownian motion. We argue that the Gaussianity assumption
  might fail to hold in deep learning settings and hence render the Brownian motion-based
  analyses inappropriate. Inspired by non-Gaussian natural phenomena, we consider
  the GN in a more general context and invoke the generalized CLT (GCLT), which suggests
  that the GN converges to a heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable random variable. Accordingly,
  we propose to analyze SGD as an SDE driven by a Lévy motion. Such SDEs can incur
  ‘jumps’, which force the SDE transition from narrow minima to wider minima, as proven
  by existing metastability theory. To validate the $\alpha$-stable assumption, we
  conduct experiments on common deep learning scenarios and show that in all settings,
  the GN is highly non-Gaussian and admits heavy-tails. We investigate the tail behavior
  in varying network architectures and sizes, loss functions, and datasets. Our results
  open up a different perspective and shed more light on the belief that SGD prefers
  wide minima.
