abstract: Designing an incentive compatible auction that maximizes expected revenue
  is an intricate task. The single-item case was resolved in a seminal piece of work
  by Myerson in 1981. Even after 30-40 years of intense research the problem remains
  unsolved for seemingly simple multi-bidder, multi-item settings. In this work, we
  initiate the exploration of the use of tools from deep learning for the automated
  design of optimal auctions. We model an auction as a multi-layer neural network,
  frame optimal auction design as a constrained learning problem, and show how it
  can be solved using standard pipelines. We prove generalization bounds and present
  extensive experiments, recovering essentially all known analytical solutions for
  multi-item settings, and obtaining novel mechanisms for settings in which the optimal
  mechanism is unknown.
