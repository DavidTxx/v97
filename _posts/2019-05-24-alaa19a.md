abstract: The problem of estimating causal effects of treatments from observational
  data falls beyond the realm of supervised learning {—} because counterfactual data
  is inaccessible, we can never observe the true causal effects. In the absence of
  "supervision", how can we evaluate the performance of causal inference methods?
  In this paper, we use influence functions {—} the functional derivatives of a loss
  function {—} to develop a model validation procedure that estimates the estimation
  error of causal inference methods. Our procedure utilizes a Taylor-like expansion
  to approximate the loss function of a method on a given dataset in terms of the
  influence functions of its loss on a "synthesized", proximal dataset with known
  causal effects. Under minimal regularity assumptions, we show that our procedure
  is consistent and efficient. Experiments on 77 benchmark datasets show that using
  our procedure, we can accurately predict the comparative performances of state-of-the-art
  causal inference methods applied to a given observational study.
