abstract: Imagine a patient in critical condition. What and when should be measured
  to forecast detrimental events, especially under the budget constraints? We answer
  this question by deep reinforcement learning (RL) that jointly minimizes the measurement
  cost and maximizes predictive gain, by scheduling strategically-timed measurements.
  We learn our policy to be dynamically dependent on the patientâ€™s health history.
  To scale our framework to exponentially large action space, we distribute our reward
  in a sequential setting that makes the learning easier. In our simulation, our policy
  outperforms heuristic-based scheduling with higher predictive gain and lower cost.
  In a real-world ICU mortality prediction task (MIMIC3), our policies reduce the
  total number of measurements by 31% or improve predictive gain by a factor of 3
  as compared to physicians, under the off-policy policy evaluation.
