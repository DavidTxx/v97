abstract: We consider online learning with linear models, where the algorithm predicts
  on sequentially revealed instances (feature vectors), and is compared against the
  best linear function (comparator) in hindsight. Popular algorithms in this framework,
  such as Online Gradient Descent (OGD), have parameters (learning rates), which ideally
  should be tuned based on the scales of the features and the optimal comparator,
  but these quantities only become available at the end of the learning process. In
  this paper, we resolve the tuning problem by proposing online algorithms making
  predictions which are invariant under arbitrary rescaling of the features. The algorithms
  have no parameters to tune, do not require any prior knowledge on the scale of the
  instances or the comparator, and achieve regret bounds matching (up to a logarithmic
  factor) that of OGD with optimally tuned separate learning rates per dimension,
  while retaining comparable runtime performance.
