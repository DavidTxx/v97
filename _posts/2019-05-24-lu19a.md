abstract: Alternating gradient descent (A-GD) is a simple but popular algorithm in
  machine learning, which updates two blocks of variables in an alternating manner
  using gradient descent steps. In this paper, we consider a smooth unconstrained
  nonconvex optimization problem, and propose a perturbed A-GD (PA-GD) which is able
  to converge (with high probability) to the second-order stationary points (SOSPs)
  with a global sublinear rate. Existing analysis on A-GD type algorithm either only
  guarantees convergence to first-order solutions, or converges to second-order solutions
  asymptotically (without rates). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  alternating type algorithm that takes $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(d)/\epsilon^2)$
  iterations to achieve an ($\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon}$)-SOSP with high probability,
  where polylog$(d)$ denotes the polynomial of the logarithm with respect to problem
  dimension $d$.
