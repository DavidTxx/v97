abstract: We consider the problem of privacy-amplification by under the Renyi Differential
  Privacy framework. This is the main technique underlying the moments accountants
  (Abadi et al., 2016) for differentially private deep learning. Unlike previous attempts
  on this problem which deals with Sampling with Replacement, we consider the Poisson
  subsampling scheme which selects each data point independently with a coin toss.
  This allows us to significantly simplify and tighten the bounds for the RDP of subsampled
  mechanisms and derive numerically stable approximation schemes. In particular, for
  subsampled Gaussian mechanism and subsampled Laplace mechanism, we prove an analytical
  formula of their RDP that exactly matches the lower bound. The result is the first
  of its kind and we numerically demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in
  the privacy-utility tradeoff.
