abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization is a powerful tool for learning useful
  representations in the data and has been widely applied in many problems such as
  data mining and signal processing. Orthogonal NMF, which can improve the locality
  of decomposition, has drawn considerable interest in solving clustering problems
  in recent years. However, imposing simultaneous non-negative and orthogonal structure
  can be quite difficult, and so existing algorithms can only solve it approximately.
  To address this challenge, we propose an innovative procedure called Greedy Orthogonal
  Pivoting Algorithm (GOPA). The GOPA algorithm fully exploits the sparsity of non-negative
  orthogonal solutions to break the global problem into a series of local optimizations,
  in which an adaptive subset of coordinates are updated in a greedy, closed-form
  manner. The biggest advantage of GOPA is that it promotes exact orthogonality and
  provides solid empirical evidence that stronger orthogonality does contribute favorably
  to better clustering performance. On the other hand, we further design randomized
  and parallel version of GOPA, which can further reduce the computational cost and
  improve accuracy, making it suitable for large data.
