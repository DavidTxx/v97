abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a unifying view of a wide range of
  problems of interest in machine learning by framing them as the minimization of
  functionals defined on the space of probability measures. In particular, we show
  that generative adversarial networks, variational inference, and actor-critic methods
  in reinforcement learning can all be seen through the lens of our framework. We
  then discuss a generic optimization algorithm for our formulation, called probability
  functional descent (PFD), and show how this algorithm recovers existing methods
  developed independently in the settings mentioned earlier.
