abstract: We study the problem of detecting critical structures using a graph embedding
  model. Existing graph embedding models lack the ability to precisely detect critical
  structures that are specific to a task at the global scale. In this paper, we propose
  a novel graph embedding model, called the Ego-CNNs, that employs the ego-convolutions
  convolutions at each layer and stacks up layers using an ego-centric way to detects
  precise critical structures efficiently. An Ego-CNN can be jointly trained with
  a task model and help explain/discover knowledge for the task. We conduct extensive
  experiments and the results show that Ego-CNNs (1) can lead to comparable task performance
  as the state-of-the-art graph embedding models, (2) works nicely with CNN visualization
  techniques to illustrate the detected structures, and (3) is efficient and can incorporate
  with scale-free priors, which commonly occurs in social network datasets, to further
  improve the training efficiency.
