abstract: Representation and learning of long-range dependencies is a central challenge
  confronted in modern applications of machine learning to sequence data. Yet despite
  the prominence of this issue, the basic problem of measuring long-range dependence,
  either in a given data source or as represented in a trained deep model, remains
  largely limited to heuristic tools. We contribute a statistical framework for investigating
  long-range dependence in current applications of deep sequence modeling, drawing
  on the well-developed theory of long memory stochastic processes. This framework
  yields testable implications concerning the relationship between long memory in
  real-world data and its learned representation in a deep learning architecture,
  which are explored through a semiparametric framework adapted to the high-dimensional
  setting.
