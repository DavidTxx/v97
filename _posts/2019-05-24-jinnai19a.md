abstract: We formalize the problem of selecting the optimal set of options for planning
  as that of computing the smallest set of options so that planning converges in less
  than a given maximum of value-iteration passes. We first show that the problem is
  $\NP$-hard, even if the task is constrained to be deterministicâ€”the first such complexity
  result for option discovery. We then present the first polynomial-time boundedly
  suboptimal approximation algorithm for this setting, and empirically evaluate it
  against both the optimal options and a representative collection of heuristic approaches
  in simple grid-based domains.
