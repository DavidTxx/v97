abstract: In this work, we study the Submodular Cost Submodular Cover problem, which
  is to minimize the submodular cost required to ensure that the submodular benefit
  function exceeds a given threshold. Existing approximation ratios for the greedy
  algorithm assume a value oracle to the benefit function. However, access to a value
  oracle is not a realistic assumption for many applications of this problem, where
  the benefit function is difficult to compute. We present two incomparable approximation
  ratios for this problem with an approximate value oracle and demonstrate that the
  ratios take on empirically relevant values through a case study with the Influence
  Threshold problem in online social networks.
