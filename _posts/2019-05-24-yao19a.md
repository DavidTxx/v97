abstract: Nonconvex regularizers have been successfully used in low-rank matrix learning.
  In this paper, we extend this to the more challenging problem of low-rank tensor
  completion. Based on the proximal average algorithm, we develop an efficient solver
  that avoids expensive tensor folding and unfolding. A special â€œsparse plus low-rank"
  structure, which is essential for fast computation of individual proximal steps,
  is maintained throughout the iterations. We also incorporate adaptive momentum to
  further speed up empirical convergence. Convergence results to critical points are
  provided under smoothness and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz conditions. Experimental results
  on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm
  is more efficient in both time and space, and is also more accurate than existing
  approaches.
