abstract: 'Policy gradient methods ignore the potential value of adjusting environment
  variables: unobservable state features that are randomly determined by the environment
  in a physical setting, but are controllable in a simulator. This can lead to slow
  learning, or convergence to suboptimal policies, if the environment variable has
  a large impact on the transition dynamics. In this paper, we present fingerprint
  policy optimisation (FPO), which finds a policy that is optimal in expectation across
  the distribution of environment variables. The central idea is to use Bayesian optimisation
  (BO) to actively select the distribution of the environment variable that maximises
  the improvement generated by each iteration of the policy gradient method. To make
  this BO practical, we contribute two easy-to-compute low-dimensional fingerprints
  of the current policy. Our experiments show that FPO can efficiently learn policies
  that are robust to significant rare events, which are unlikely to be observable
  under random sampling, but are key to learning good policies.'
