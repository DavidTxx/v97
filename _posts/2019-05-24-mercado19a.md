abstract: Signed graphs encode positive (attractive) and negative (repulsive) relations
  between nodes. We extend spectral clustering to signed graphs via the one-parameter
  family of Signed Power Mean Laplacians, defined as the matrix power mean of normalized
  standard and signless Laplacians of positive and negative edges. We provide a thorough
  analysis of the proposed approach in the setting of a general Stochastic Block Model
  that includes models such as the Labeled Stochastic Block Model and the Censored
  Block Model. We show that in expectation the signed power mean Laplacian captures
  the ground truth clusters under reasonable settings where state-of-the-art approaches
  fail. Moreover, we prove that the eigenvalues and eigenvector of the signed power
  mean Laplacian concentrate around their expectation under reasonable conditions
  in the general Stochastic Block Model. Extensive experiments on random graphs and
  real world datasets confirm the theoretically predicted behaviour of the signed
  power mean Laplacian and show that it compares favourably with state-of-the-art
  methods.
