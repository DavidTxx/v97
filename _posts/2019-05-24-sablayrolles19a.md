abstract: Membership inference determines, given a sample and trained parameters of
  a machine learning model, whether the sample was part of the training set. In this
  paper, we derive the optimal strategy for membership inference with a few assumptions
  on the distribution of the parameters. We show that optimal attacks only depend
  on the loss function, and thus black-box attacks are as good as white-box attacks.
  As the optimal strategy is not tractable, we provide approximations of it leading
  to several inference methods, and show that existing membership inference methods
  are coarser approximations of this optimal strategy. Our membership attacks outperform
  the state of the art in various settings, ranging from a simple logistic regression
  to more complex architectures and datasets, such as ResNet-101 and Imagenet.
