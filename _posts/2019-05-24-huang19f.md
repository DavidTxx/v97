abstract: In most machine learning training paradigms a fixed, often handcrafted,
  loss function is assumed to be a good proxy for an underlying evaluation metric.
  In this work we assess this assumption by meta-learning an adaptive loss function
  to directly optimize the evaluation metric. We propose a sample efficient reinforcement
  learning approach for adapting the loss dynamically during training. We empirically
  show how this formulation improves performance by simultaneously optimizing the
  evaluation metric and smoothing the loss landscape. We verify our method in metric
  learning and classification scenarios, showing considerable improvements over the
  state-of-the-art on a diverse set of tasks. Importantly, our method is applicable
  to a wide range of loss functions and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the learned
  policies are transferable across tasks and data, demonstrating the versatility of
  the method.
