abstract: 'Batch Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been successfully applied to hyperparameter
  tuning using parallel computing, but it is wasteful of resources: workers that complete
  jobs ahead of others are left idle. We address this problem by developing an approach,
  Penalising Locally for Asynchronous Bayesian Optimisation on K Workers (PLAyBOOK),
  for asynchronous parallel BO. We demonstrate empirically the efficacy of PLAyBOOK
  and its variants on synthetic tasks and a real-world problem. We undertake a comparison
  between synchronous and asynchronous BO, and show that asynchronous BO often outperforms
  synchronous batch BO in both wall-clock time and sample efficiency.'
