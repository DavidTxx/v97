abstract: We devise a distributional variant of gradient temporal-difference (TD)
  learning. Distributional reinforcement learning has been demonstrated to outperform
  the regular one in the recent study \citep{bellemare2017distributional}. In the
  policy evaluation setting, we design two new algorithms called distributional GTD2
  and distributional TDC using the Cram{Ã©}r distance on the distributional version
  of the Bellman error objective function, which inherits advantages of both the nonlinear
  gradient TD algorithms and the distributional RL approach. In the control setting,
  we propose the distributional Greedy-GQ using similar derivation. We prove the asymptotic
  almost-sure convergence of distributional GTD2 and TDC to a local optimal solution
  for general smooth function approximators, which includes neural networks that have
  been widely used in recent study to solve the real-life RL problems. In each step,
  the computational complexity of above three algorithms is linear w.r.t. the number
  of the parameters of the function approximator, thus can be implemented efficiently
  for neural networks.
