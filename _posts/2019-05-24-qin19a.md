abstract: 'Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models designed by
  an adversary to cause an incorrect output. So far, adversarial examples have been
  studied most extensively in the image domain. In this domain, adversarial examples
  can be constructed by imperceptibly modifying images to cause misclassification,
  and are practical in the physical world. In contrast, current targeted adversarial
  examples on speech recognition systems have neither of these properties: humans
  can easily identify the adversarial perturbations, and they are not effective when
  played over-the-air. This paper makes progress on both of these fronts. First, we
  develop effectively imperceptible audio adversarial examples (verified through a
  human study) by leveraging the psychoacoustic principle of auditory masking, while
  retaining 100% targeted success rate on arbitrary full-sentence targets. Then, we
  make progress towards physical-world audio adversarial examples by constructing
  perturbations which remain effective even after applying highly-realistic simulated
  environmental distortions.'
