abstract: 'Recent progress in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled
  a simple paradigm of architecture design: larger models typically achieve better
  accuracy. Due to this, in modern CNN architectures, it becomes more important to
  design models that generalize well under certain resource constraints, e.g. the
  number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a simple way to improve the capacity
  of any CNN model having large-scale features, without adding more parameters. In
  particular, we modify a standard convolutional layer to have a new functionality
  of channel-selectivity, so that the layer is trained to select important channels
  to re-distribute their parameters. Our experimental results under various CNN architectures
  and datasets demonstrate that the proposed new convolutional layer allows new optima
  that generalize better via efficient resource utilization, compared to the baseline.'
