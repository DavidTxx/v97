abstract: While model-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for
  sample efficiency and generalization, learning an accurate dynamics model is often
  challenging and requires substantial interaction with the environment. A wide variety
  of domains have dynamics that share common foundations like the laws of classical
  mechanics, which are rarely exploited by existing algorithms. In fact, humans continuously
  acquire and use such dynamics priors to easily adapt to operating in new environments.
  In this work, we propose an approach to learn task-agnostic dynamics priors from
  videos and incorporate them into an RL agent. Our method involves pre-training a
  frame predictor on task-agnostic physics videos to initialize dynamics models (and
  fine-tune them) for unseen target environments. Our frame prediction architecture,
  SpatialNet, is designed specifically to capture localized physical phenomena and
  interactions. Our approach allows for both faster policy learning and convergence
  to better policies, outperforming competitive approaches on several different environments.
  We also demonstrate that incorporating this prior allows for more effective transfer
  between environments.
