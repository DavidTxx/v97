abstract: We propose a novel model for temporal detection and localization which allows
  the training of deep neural networks using only counts of event occurrences as training
  labels. This powerful weakly-supervised framework alleviates the burden of the imprecise
  and time consuming process of annotating event locations in temporal data. Unlike
  existing methods, in which localization is explicitly achieved by design, our model
  learns localization implicitly as a byproduct of learning to count instances. This
  unique feature is a direct consequence of the modelâ€™s theoretical properties. We
  validate the effectiveness of our approach in a number of experiments (drum hit
  and piano onset detection in audio, digit detection in images) and demonstrate performance
  comparable to that of fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods, despite much weaker
  training requirements.
