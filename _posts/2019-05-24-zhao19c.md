abstract: Quantization can improve the execution latency and energy efficiency of
  neural networks on both commodity GPUs and specialized accelerators. The majority
  of existing literature focuses on training quantized DNNs, while this work examines
  the less-studied topic of quantizing a floating-point model without (re)training.
  DNN weights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution post-training, while
  practical hardware uses a linear quantization grid. This leads to challenges in
  dealing with outliers in the distribution. Prior work has addressed this by clipping
  the outliers or using specialized hardware. In this work, we propose outlier channel
  splitting (OCS), which duplicates channels containing outliers, then halves the
  channel values. The network remains functionally identical, but affected outliers
  are moved toward the center of the distribution. OCS requires no additional training
  and works on commodity hardware. Experimental evaluation on ImageNet classification
  and language modeling shows that OCS can outperform state-of-the-art clipping techniques
  with only minor overhead.
