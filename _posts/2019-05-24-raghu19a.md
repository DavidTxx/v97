abstract: The issue of disagreements amongst human experts is a ubiquitous one in
  both machine learning and medicine. In medicine, this often corresponds to doctor
  disagreements on a patient diagnosis. In this work, we show that machine learning
  models can be successfully trained to give uncertainty scores to data instances
  that result in high expert disagreements. In particular, they can identify patient
  cases that would benefit most from a medical second opinion. Our central methodological
  finding is that Direct Uncertainty Prediction (DUP), training a model to predict
  an uncertainty score directly from the raw patient features, works better than Uncertainty
  Via Classification, the two step process of training a classifier and postprocessing
  the output distribution to give an uncertainty score. We show this both with a theoretical
  result, and on extensive evaluations on a large scale medical imaging application.
