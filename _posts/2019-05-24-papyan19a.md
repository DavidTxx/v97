abstract: We expose a structure in deep classifying neural networks in the derivative
  of the logits with respect to the parameters of the model, which is used to explain
  the existence of outliers in the spectrum of the Hessian. Previous works decomposed
  the Hessian into two components, attributing the outliers to one of them, the so-called
  Covariance of gradients. We show this term is not a Covariance but a second moment
  matrix, i.e., it is influenced by means of gradients. These means possess an additive
  two-way structure that is the source of the outliers in the spectrum. This structure
  can be used to approximate the principal subspace of the Hessian using certain "averaging"
  operations, avoiding the need for high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We corroborate
  this claim across different datasets, architectures and sample sizes.
