abstract: The use of target networks has been a popular and key component of recent
  deep Q-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning, yet little is known from
  the theory side. In this work, we introduce a new family of target-based temporal
  difference (TD) learning algorithms that maintain two separate learning parameters
  {â€“} the target variable and online variable. We propose three members in the family,
  the averaging TD, double TD, and periodic TD, where the target variable is updated
  through an averaging, symmetric, or periodic fashion, respectively, mirroring those
  techniques used in deep Q-learning practice. We establish asymptotic convergence
  analyses for both averaging TD and double TD and a finite sample analysis for periodic
  TD. In addition, we provide some simulation results showing potentially superior
  convergence of these target-based TD algorithms compared to the standard TD-learning.
  While this work focuses on linear function approximation and policy evaluation setting,
  we consider this as a meaningful step towards the theoretical understanding of deep
  Q-learning variants with target networks.
