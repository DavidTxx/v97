abstract: 'We present and investigate a novel and timely application domain for deep
  reinforcement learning (RL): Internet congestion control. Congestion control is
  the core networking task of modulating traffic sourcesâ€™ data-transmission rates
  to efficiently utilize network capacity, and is the subject of extensive attention
  in light of the advent of Internet services such as live video, virtual reality,
  Internet-of-Things, and more. We show that casting congestion control as RL enables
  training deep network policies that capture intricate patterns in data traffic and
  network conditions, and leverage this to outperform the state-of-the-art. We also
  highlight significant challenges facing real-world adoption of RL-based congestion
  control, including fairness, safety, and generalization, which are not trivial to
  address within conventional RL formalism. To facilitate further research and reproducibility
  of our results, we present a test suite for RL-guided congestion control based on
  the OpenAI Gym interface.'
