abstract: The ability to perform offline A/B-testing and off-policy learning using
  logged contextual bandit feedback is highly desirable in a broad range of applications,
  including recommender systems, search engines, ad placement, and personalized health
  care. Both offline A/B-testing and off-policy learning require a counterfactual
  estimator that evaluates how some new policy would have performed, if it had been
  used instead of the logging policy. In this paper, we identify a family of counterfactual
  estimators which subsumes most such estimators proposed to date. Our analysis of
  this family identifies a new estimator - called Continuous Adaptive Blending (CAB)
  - which enjoys many advantageous theoretical and practical properties. In particular,
  it can be substantially less biased than clipped Inverse Propensity Score (IPS)
  weighting and the Direct Method, and it can have less variance than Doubly Robust
  and IPS estimators. In addition, it is sub-differentiable such that it can be used
  for learning, unlike the SWITCH estimator. Experimental results show that CAB provides
  excellent evaluation accuracy and outperforms other counterfactual estimators in
  terms of learning performance.
