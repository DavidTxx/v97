abstract: System identification of complex and nonlinear systems is a central problem
  for model predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning. Despite their
  complexity, such systems can often be approximated well by a set of linear dynamical
  systems if broken into appropriate subsequences. This mechanism not only helps us
  find good approximations of dynamics, but also gives us deeper insight into the
  underlying system. Leveraging Bayesian inference, Variational Autoencoders and Concrete
  relaxations, we show how to learn a richer and more meaningful state space, e.g.
  encoding joint constraints and collisions with walls in a maze, from partial and
  high-dimensional observations. This representation translates into a gain of accuracy
  of learned dynamics showcased on various simulated tasks.
