abstract: Contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have been shown promising
  for maximizing cumulative rewards in sequential decision tasks such as news article
  recommendation systems, web page ad placement algorithms, and mobile health. However,
  most of the proposed contextual MAB algorithms assume linear relationships between
  the reward and the context of the action. This paper proposes a new contextual MAB
  algorithm for a relaxed, semiparametric reward model that supports nonstationarity.
  The proposed method is less restrictive, easier to implement and faster than two
  alternative algorithms that consider the same model, while achieving a tight regret
  upper bound. We prove that the high-probability upper bound of the regret incurred
  by the proposed algorithm has the same order as the Thompson sampling algorithm
  for linear reward models. The proposed and existing algorithms are evaluated via
  simulation and also applied to Yahoo! news article recommendation log data.
