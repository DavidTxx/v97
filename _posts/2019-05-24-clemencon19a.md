abstract: 'Tournament procedures, recently introduced in the literature, offer an
  appealing alternative, from a theoretical perspective at least, to the principle
  of Empirical Risk Minimization in machine learning. Statistical learning by Median-of-Means
  (MoM) basically consists in segmenting the training data into blocks of equal size
  and comparing the statistical performance of every pair of candidate decision rules
  on each data block: that with highest performance on the majority of the blocks
  is declared as the winner. In the context of nonparametric regression, functions
  having won all their duels have been shown to outperform empirical risk minimizers
  w.r.t. the mean squared error under minimal assumptions, while exhibiting robustness
  properties. It is the purpose of this paper to extend this approach, in order to
  address other learning problems in particular, for which the performance criterion
  takes the form of an expectation over pairs of observations rather than over one
  single observation, as may be the case in pairwise ranking, clustering or metric
  learning. Precisely, it is proved here that the bounds achieved by MoM are essentially
  conserved when the blocks are built by means of independent sampling without replacement
  schemes instead of a simple segmentation. These results are next extended to situations
  where the risk is related to a pairwise loss function and its empirical counterpart
  is of the form of a $U$-statistic. Beyond theoretical results guaranteeing the performance
  of the learning/estimation methods proposed, some numerical experiments provide
  empirical evidence of their relevance in practice.'
