abstract: 'Recent works have cast some light on the mystery of why deep nets fit any
  data and generalize despite being very overparametrized. This paper analyzes training
  and generalization for a simple 2-layer ReLU net with random initialization, and
  provides the following improvements over recent works: (i) Using a tighter characterization
  of training speed than recent papers, an explanation for why training a neural net
  with random labels leads to slower training, as originally observed in [Zhang et
  al. ICLRâ€™17]. (ii) Generalization bound independent of network size, using a data-dependent
  complexity measure. Our measure distinguishes clearly between random labels and
  true labels on MNIST and CIFAR, as shown by experiments. Moreover, recent papers
  require sample complexity to increase (slowly) with the size, while our sample complexity
  is completely independent of the network size. (iii) Learnability of a broad class
  of smooth functions by 2-layer ReLU nets trained via gradient descent. The key idea
  is to track dynamics of training and generalization via properties of a related
  kernel.'
