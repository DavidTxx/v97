abstract: The recent Attend-Infer-Repeat (AIR) framework marks a milestone in structured
  probabilistic modeling, as it tackles the challenging problem of unsupervised scene
  understanding via Bayesian inference. AIR expresses the composition of visual scenes
  from individual objects, and uses variational autoencoders to model the appearance
  of those objects. However, inference in the overall model is highly intractable,
  which hampers its learning speed and makes it prone to suboptimal solutions. In
  this paper, we show that the speed and robustness of learning in AIR can be considerably
  improved by replacing the intractable object representations with tractable probabilistic
  models. In particular, we opt for sum-product networks (SPNs), expressive deep probabilistic
  models with a rich set of tractable inference routines. The resulting model, called
  SuPAIR, learns an order of magnitude faster than AIR, treats object occlusions in
  a consistent manner, and allows for the inclusion of a background noise model, improving
  the robustness of Bayesian scene understanding.
