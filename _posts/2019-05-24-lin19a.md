abstract: We provide theoretical analyses for two algorithms that solve the regularized
  optimal transport (OT) problem between two discrete probability measures with at
  most $n$ atoms. We show that a greedy variant of the classical Sinkhorn algorithm,
  known as the <em>Greenkhorn algorithm</em>, can be improved to $\bigOtil\left(n^2/\varepsilon^2\right)$,
  improving on the best known complexity bound of $\bigOtil\left(n^2/\varepsilon^3\right)$.
  This matches the best known complexity bound for the Sinkhorn algorithm and helps
  explain why the Greenkhorn algorithm outperforms the Sinkhorn algorithm in practice.
  Our proof technique is based on a primal-dual formulation and provide a <em>tight</em>
  upper bound for the dual solution, leading to a class of <em>adaptive primal-dual
  accelerated mirror descent</em> (APDAMD) algorithms. We prove that the complexity
  of these algorithms is $\bigOtil\left(n^2\sqrt{\gamma}/\varepsilon\right)$ in which
  $\gamma \in (0, n]$ refers to some constants in the Bregman divergence. Experimental
  results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the favorable performance of
  the Greenkhorn and APDAMD algorithms in practice.
