abstract: In this paper, we propose a faster stochastic alternating direction method
  of multipliers (ADMM) for nonconvex optimization by using a new stochastic path-integrated
  differential estimator (SPIDER), called as SPIDER-ADMM. Moreover, we prove that
  the SPIDER-ADMM achieves a record-breaking incremental first-order oracle (IFO)
  complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate solution. As one of major contribution
  of this paper, we provide a new theoretical analysis framework for nonconvex stochastic
  ADMM methods with providing the optimal IFO complexity. Based on this new analysis
  framework, we study the unsolved optimal IFO complexity of the existing non-convex
  SVRG-ADMM and SAGA-ADMM methods, and prove their the optimal IFO complexity. Thus,
  the SPIDER-ADMM improves the existing stochastic ADMM methods. Moreover, we extend
  SPIDER-ADMM to the online setting, and propose a faster online SPIDER-ADMM. Our
  theoretical analysis also derives the IFO complexity of the online SPIDER-ADMM.
  Finally, the experimental results on benchmark datasets validate that the proposed
  algorithms have faster convergence rate than the existing ADMM algorithms for nonconvex
  optimization.
