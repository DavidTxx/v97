abstract: We study the use of predictions by multiple experts (such as machine learning
  algorithms) to improve the performance of online algorithms. In particular, we consider
  the classical rent-or-buy problem (also called ski rental), and obtain algorithms
  that provably improve their performance over the adversarial scenario by using these
  predictions. We also prove matching lower bounds to show that our algorithms are
  the best possible, and perform experiments to empirically validate their performance
  in practice
