abstract: Recent studies on the adversarial vulnerability of neural networks have
  shown that models trained to be more robust to adversarial attacks exhibit more
  interpretable saliency maps than their non-robust counterparts. We aim to quantify
  this behaviour by considering the alignment between input image and saliency map.
  We hypothesize that as the distance to the decision boundary grows, so does the
  alignment. This connection is strictly true in the case of linear models. We confirm
  these theoretical findings with experiments based on models trained with a local
  Lipschitz regularization and identify where the nonlinear nature of neural networks
  weakens the relation.
