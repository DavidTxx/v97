abstract: We address the problem of inferring the causal effect of an exposure on
  an outcome across space, using observational data. The data is possibly subject
  to unmeasured confounding variables which, in a standard approach, must be adjusted
  for by estimating a nuisance function. Here we develop a method that eliminates
  the nuisance function, while mitigating the resulting errors-in-variables. The result
  is a robust and accurate inference method for spatially varying heterogeneous causal
  effects. The properties of the method are demonstrated on synthetic as well as real
  data from Germany and the US.
