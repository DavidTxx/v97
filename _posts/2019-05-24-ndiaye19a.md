abstract: 'Popular machine learning estimators involve regularization parameters that
  can be challenging to tune, and standard strategies rely on grid search for this
  task. In this paper, we revisit the techniques of approximating the regularization
  path up to predefined tolerance $\epsilon$ in a unified framework and show that
  its complexity is $O(1/\sqrt[d]{\epsilon})$ for uniformly convex loss of order $d
  \geq 2$ and $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for Generalized Self-Concordant functions. This
  framework encompasses least-squares but also logistic regression, a case that as
  far as we know was not handled as precisely in previous works. We leverage our technique
  to provide refined bounds on the validation error as well as a practical algorithm
  for hyperparameter tuning. The latter has global convergence guarantee when targeting
  a prescribed accuracy on the validation set. Last but not least, our approach helps
  relieving the practitioner from the (often neglected) task of selecting a stopping
  criterion when optimizing over the training set: our method automatically calibrates
  this criterion based on the targeted accuracy on the validation set.'
