abstract: In this work, we present a reinforcement learning algorithm that can find
  a variety of policies (novel policies) for a task that is given by a task reward
  function. Our method does this by creating a second reward function that recognizes
  previously seen state sequences and rewards those by novelty, which is measured
  using autoencoders that have been trained on state sequences from previously discovered
  policies. We present a two-objective update technique for policy gradient algorithms
  in which each update of the policy is a compromise between improving the task reward
  and improving the novelty reward. Using this method, we end up with a collection
  of policies that solves a given task as well as carrying out action sequences that
  are distinct from one another. We demonstrate this method on maze navigation tasks,
  a reaching task for a simulated robot arm, and a locomotion task for a hopper. We
  also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on deceptive tasks in which policy
  gradient methods often get stuck.
