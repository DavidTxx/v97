abstract: 'We develop a method to combine Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational
  inference (VI), leveraging the advantages of both inference approaches. Specifically,
  we improve the variational distribution by running a few MCMC steps. To make inference
  tractable, we introduce the variational contrastive divergence (VCD), a new divergence
  that replaces the standard Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence used in VI. The VCD
  captures a notion of discrepancy between the initial variational distribution and
  its improved version (obtained after running the MCMC steps), and it converges asymptotically
  to the symmetrized KL divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior
  of interest. The VCD objective can be optimized efficiently with respect to the
  variational parameters via stochastic optimization. We show experimentally that
  optimizing the VCD leads to better predictive performance on two latent variable
  models: logistic matrix factorization and variational autoencoders (VAEs).'
