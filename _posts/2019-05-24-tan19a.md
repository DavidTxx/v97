abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed
  resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are given.
  In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully
  balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based
  on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions
  of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on MobileNets and ResNet. To go
  even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network
  and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve
  much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7
  achieves stateof-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being
  8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet (Huang
  et al., 2018). Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art
  accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flower (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets,
  with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
