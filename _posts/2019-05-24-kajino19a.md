abstract: 'Molecular optimization aims to discover novel molecules with desirable
  properties, and its two fundamental challenges are: (i) it is not trivial to generate
  valid molecules in a controllable way due to hard chemical constraints such as the
  valency conditions, and (ii) it is often costly to evaluate a property of a novel
  molecule, and therefore, the number of property evaluations is limited. These challenges
  are to some extent alleviated by a combination of a variational autoencoder (VAE)
  and Bayesian optimization (BO), where VAE converts a molecule into/from its latent
  continuous vector, and BO optimizes a latent continuous vector (and its corresponding
  molecule) within a limited number of property evaluations. While the most recent
  work, for the first time, achieved 100% validity, its architecture is rather complex
  due to auxiliary neural networks other than VAE, making it difficult to train. This
  paper presents a molecular hypergraph grammar variational autoencoder (MHG-VAE),
  which uses a single VAE to achieve 100% validity. Our idea is to develop a graph
  grammar encoding the hard chemical constraints, called molecular hypergraph grammar
  (MHG), which guides VAE to always generate valid molecules. We also present an algorithm
  to construct MHG from a set of molecules.'
