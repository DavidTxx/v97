abstract: 'Value-function approximation methods that operate in batch mode have foundational
  importance to reinforcement learning (RL). Finite sample guarantees for these methods
  often crucially rely on two types of assumptions: (1) mild distribution shift, and
  (2) representation conditions that are stronger than realizability. However, the
  necessity (“why do we need them?”) and the naturalness (“when do they hold?”) of
  such assumptions have largely eluded the literature. In this paper, we revisit these
  assumptions and provide theoretical results towards answering the above questions,
  and make steps towards a deeper understanding of value-function approximation.'
