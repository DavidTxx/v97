abstract: For recurrent neural networks trained on time series with target and exogenous
  variables, in addition to accurate prediction, it is also desired to provide interpretable
  insights into the data. In this paper, we explore the structure of LSTM recurrent
  neural networks to learn variable-wise hidden states, with the aim to capture different
  dynamics in multi-variable time series and distinguish the contribution of variables
  to the prediction. With these variable-wise hidden states, a mixture attention mechanism
  is proposed to model the generative process of the target. Then we develop associated
  training methods to jointly learn network parameters, variable and temporal importance
  w.r.t the prediction of the target variable. Extensive experiments on real datasets
  demonstrate enhanced prediction performance by capturing the dynamics of different
  variables. Meanwhile, we evaluate the interpretation results both qualitatively
  and quantitatively. It exhibits the prospect as an end-to-end framework for both
  forecasting and knowledge extraction over multi-variable data.
