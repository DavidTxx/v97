abstract: We present a provably optimal differentially private algorithm for the stochastic
  multi-arm bandit problem, as opposed to the private analogue of the UCB-algorithm
  (Mishra and Thakurta, 2015; Tossou and Dimitrakakis, 2016) which doesn’t meet the
  recently discovered lower-bound of $\Omega \left(\frac{K\log(T)}{\epsilon} \right)$
  (Shariff and Sheffet, 2018). Our construction is based on a different algorithm,
  Successive Elimination (Even-Dar et al., 2002), that repeatedly pulls all remaining
  arms until an arm is found to be suboptimal and is then eliminated. In order to
  devise a private analogue of Successive Elimination we visit the problem of private
  <em>stopping rule</em>, that takes as input a stream of i.i.d samples from an unknown
  distribution and returns a <em>multiplicative</em> $(1 \pm \alpha)$-approximation
  of the distribution’s mean, and prove the optimality of our private stopping rule.
  We then present the private Successive Elimination algorithm which meets both the
  non-private lower bound (Lai and Robbins, 1985) and the above-mentioned private
  lower bound. We also compare empirically the performance of our algorithm with the
  private UCB algorithm.
