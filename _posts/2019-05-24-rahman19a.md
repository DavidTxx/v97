abstract: Tractable probabilistic models obviate the need for unreliable approximate
  inference approaches and as a result often yield accurate query answers in practice.
  However, most tractable models that achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance
  (measured using test set likelihood score) use latent variables. Such models admit
  poly-time marginal (MAR) inference but do not admit poly-time (full) maximum-a-posteriori
  (MAP) inference. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach
  for inducing cutset networks, a well-known tractable, highly interpretable representation
  that does not use latent variables and admits linear time MAR as well as MAP inference.
  Our approach addresses a major limitation of existing techniques that learn cutset
  networks from data in that their accuracy is quite low as compared to latent variable
  models such as ensembles of cutset networks and sum-product networks. The key idea
  in our approach is to construct deep cutset networks by not only learning them from
  data but also compiling them from a more accurate latent tractable model. We show
  experimentally that our new approach yields more accurate MAP estimates as compared
  with existing approaches and significantly improves the test set log-likelihood
  score of cutset networks bringing them closer in terms of generalization performance
  to latent variable models.
