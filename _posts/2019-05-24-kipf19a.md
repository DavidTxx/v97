abstract: 'We introduce Compositional Imitation Learning and Execution (CompILE):
  a framework for learning reusable, variable-length segments of hierarchically-structured
  behavior from demonstration data. CompILE uses a novel unsupervised, fully-differentiable
  sequence segmentation module to learn latent encodings of sequential data that can
  be re-composed and executed to perform new tasks. Once trained, our model generalizes
  to sequences of longer length and from environment instances not seen during training.
  We evaluate CompILE in a challenging 2D multi-task environment and a continuous
  control task, and show that it can find correct task boundaries and event encodings
  in an unsupervised manner. Latent codes and associated behavior policies discovered
  by CompILE can be used by a hierarchical agent, where the high-level policy selects
  actions in the latent code space, and the low-level, task-specific policies are
  simply the learned decoders. We found that our CompILE-based agent could learn given
  only sparse rewards, where agents without task-specific policies struggle.'
