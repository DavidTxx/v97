abstract: 'The Differential privacy overview of Apple states, â€œApple retains the collected
  data for a maximum of three months." Analysis of recent data is formalized by the
  <em>sliding window model</em>. This begs the question: what is the price of privacy
  in the sliding window model? In this paper, we study heavy hitters in the sliding
  window model with window size $w$. Previous works of Chan et al. (2012) estimates
  heavy hitters with an error of order $\theta w$ for a constant $\theta >0$. In this
  paper, we give an efficient differentially private algorithm to estimate heavy hitters
  in the sliding window model with $\widetilde O(w^{3/4})$ additive error and using
  $\widetilde O(\sqrt{w})$ space.'
