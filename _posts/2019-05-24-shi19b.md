abstract: Active learning for multi-label classification poses fundamental challenges
  given the complex label correlations and a potentially large and sparse label space.
  We propose a novel CS-BPCA process that integrates compressed sensing and Bayesian
  principal component analysis to perform a two-level label transformation, resulting
  in an optimally compressed continuous target space. Besides leveraging correlation
  and sparsity of a large label space for effective compression, an optimal compressing
  rate and the relative importance of the resultant targets are automatically determined
  through Bayesian inference. Furthermore, the orthogonality of the transformed space
  completely decouples the correlations among targets, which significantly simplifies
  multi-label sampling in the target space. We define a novel sampling function that
  leverages a multi-output Gaussian Process (MOGP). Gradient-free optimization strategies
  are developed to achieve fast online hyper-parameter learning and model retraining
  for active learning. Experimental results over multiple real-world datasets and
  comparison with competitive multi-label active learning models demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed framework.
