abstract: In recommender systems, usually the ratings of a user to most items are
  missing and a critical problem is that the missing ratings are often missing not
  at random (MNAR) in reality. It is widely acknowledged that MNAR ratings make it
  difficult to accurately predict the ratings and unbiasedly estimate the performance
  of rating prediction. Recent approaches use imputed errors to recover the prediction
  errors for missing ratings, or weight observed ratings with the propensities of
  being observed. These approaches can still be severely biased in performance estimation
  or suffer from the variance of the propensities. To overcome these limitations,
  we first propose an estimator that integrates the imputed errors and propensities
  in a doubly robust way to obtain unbiased performance estimation and alleviate the
  effect of the propensity variance. To achieve good performance guarantees, based
  on this estimator, we propose joint learning of rating prediction and error imputation,
  which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four real-world datasets.
