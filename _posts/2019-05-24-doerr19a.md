abstract: Policy gradient methods are powerful reinforcement learning algorithms and
  have been demonstrated to solve many complex tasks. However, these methods are also
  data-inefficient, afflicted with high variance gradient estimates, and frequently
  get stuck in local optima. This work addresses these weaknesses by combining recent
  improvements in the reuse of off-policy data and exploration in parameter space
  with deterministic behavioral policies. The resulting objective is amenable to standard
  neural network optimization strategies like stochastic gradient descent or stochastic
  gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Incorporation of previous rollouts via importance
  sampling greatly improves data-efficiency, whilst stochastic optimization schemes
  facilitate the escape from local optima. We evaluate the proposed approach on a
  series of continuous control benchmark tasks. The results show that the proposed
  algorithm is able to successfully and reliably learn solutions using fewer system
  interactions than standard policy gradient methods.
