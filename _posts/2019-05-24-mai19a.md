abstract: This paper introduces an efficient second-order method for solving the elastic
  net problem. Its key innovation is a computationally efficient technique for injecting
  curvature information in the optimization process which admits a strong theoretical
  performance guarantee. In particular, we show improved run time over popular first-order
  methods and quantify the speed-up in terms of statistical measures of the data matrix.
  The improved time complexity is the result of an extensive exploitation of the problem
  structure and a careful combination of second-order information, variance reduction
  techniques, and momentum acceleration. Beside theoretical speed-up, experimental
  results demonstrate great practical performance benefits of curvature information,
  especially for ill-conditioned data sets.
