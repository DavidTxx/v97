abstract: The performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm can vary drastically
  during learning because of exploration. Existing algorithms provide little information
  about the quality of their current policy before executing it, and thus have limited
  use in high-stakes applications like healthcare. We address this lack of accountability
  by proposing that algorithms output policy certificates. These certificates bound
  the sub-optimality and return of the policy in the next episode, allowing humans
  to intervene when the certified quality is not satisfactory. We further introduce
  two new algorithms with certificates and present a new framework for theoretical
  analysis that guarantees the quality of their policies and certificates. For tabular
  MDPs, we show that computing certificates can even improve the sample-efficiency
  of optimism-based exploration. As a result, one of our algorithms is the first to
  achieve minimax-optimal PAC bounds up to lower-order terms, and this algorithm also
  matches (and in some settings slightly improves upon) existing minimax regret bounds.
