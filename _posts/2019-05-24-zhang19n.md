abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the composition of a smooth function
  (which can be nonconvex) and a smooth vector mapping, where both of them can be
  express as the average of a large number of components. We propose a composite randomized
  incremental gradient method by extending the SAGA framework. The gradient sample
  complexity of our method matches that of several recently developed methods based
  on SVRG in the general case. However, for structured problems where linear convergence
  rates can be obtained, our method can be much better for ill-conditioned problems.
  In addition, when the finite-sum structure only appear for the inner mapping, the
  sample complexity of our method is the same as that of SAGA for minimizing finite
  sum of smooth nonconvex functions, despite the additional outer composition and
  the stochastic composite gradients being biased in our case.
