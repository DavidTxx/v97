abstract: Optimization of machine learning models is commonly performed through stochastic
  gradient updates on randomly ordered training examples. This practice means that
  each fraction of an epoch comprises an independent random sample of the training
  data that may not preserve informative structure present in the full data. We hypothesize
  that the training can be more effective with <em>self-similar</em> arrangements
  that potentially allow each epoch to provide benefits of multiple ones. We study
  this for “matrix factorization” – the common task of learning metric embeddings
  of entities such as queries, videos, or words from example pairwise associations.
  We construct arrangements that preserve the weighted Jaccard similarities of rows
  and columns and experimentally observe training acceleration of 3%-37% on synthetic
  and recommendation datasets. Principled arrangements of training examples emerge
  as a novel and potentially powerful enhancement to SGD that merits further exploration.
