abstract: There are great interests as well as many challenges in applying reinforcement
  learning (RL) to recommendation systems. In this setting, an online user is the
  environment; neither the reward function nor the environment dynamics are clearly
  defined, making the application of RL challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel
  model-based reinforcement learning framework for recommendation systems, where we
  develop a generative adversarial network to imitate user behavior dynamics and learn
  her reward function. Using this user model as the simulation environment, we develop
  a novel Cascading DQN algorithm to obtain a combinatorial recommendation policy
  which can handle a large number of candidate items efficiently. In our experiments
  with real data, we show this generative adversarial user model can better explain
  user behavior than alternatives, and the RL policy based on this model can lead
  to a better long-term reward for the user and higher click rate for the system.
