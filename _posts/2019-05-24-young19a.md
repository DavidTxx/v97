abstract: Generative models have become significantly more powerful in recent years.
  However, these models continue to have difficulty capturing global structure in
  data. For example, images of buildings typically contain spatial patterns such as
  windows repeating at regular intervals, but state-of-the-art models have difficulty
  generating these patterns. We propose to address this problem by incorporating programs
  representing global structure into generative models{—}e.g., a 2D for-loop may represent
  a repeating pattern of windows{—}along with a framework for learning these models
  by leveraging program synthesis to obtain training data. On both synthetic and real-world
  data, we demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
  at both generating and completing images with global structure.
