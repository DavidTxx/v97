abstract: Modern machine learning methods often require more data for training than
  a single expert can provide. Therefore, it has become a standard procedure to collect
  data from multiple external sources, \eg via crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, the quality
  of these sources is not always guaranteed. As further complications, the data might
  be stored in a distributed way, or might even have to remain private. In this work,
  we address the question of how to learn robustly in such scenarios. Studying the
  problem through the lens of statistical learning theory, we derive a procedure that
  allows for learning from all available sources, yet automatically suppresses irrelevant
  or corrupted data. We show by extensive experiments that our method provides significant
  improvements over alternative approaches from robust statistics and distributed
  optimization.
