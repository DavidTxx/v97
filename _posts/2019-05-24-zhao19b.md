abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often have complex test metrics,
  and may have training and test data that are not identically distributed. Motivated
  by known connections between complex test metrics and cost-weighted learning, we
  propose addressing these issues by using a weighted loss function with a standard
  loss, where the weights on the training examples are learned to optimize the test
  metric on a validation set. These metric-optimized example weights can be learned
  for any test metric, including black box and customized ones for specific applications.
  We illustrate the performance of the proposed method on diverse public benchmark
  datasets and real-world applications. We also provide a generalization bound for
  the method.
