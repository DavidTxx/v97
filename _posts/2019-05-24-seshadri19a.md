abstract: Many applications in preference learning assume that decisions come from
  the maximization of a stable utility function. Yet a large experimental literature
  shows that individual choices and judgements can be affected by “irrelevant” aspects
  of the context in which they are made. An important class of such contexts is the
  composition of the choice set. In this work, our goal is to discover such choice
  set effects from raw choice data. We introduce an extension of the Multinomial Logit
  (MNL) model, called the context dependent random utility model (CDM), which allows
  for a particular class of choice set effects. We show that the CDM can be thought
  of as a second-order approximation to a general choice system, can be inferred optimally
  using maximum likelihood and, importantly, is easily interpretable. We apply the
  CDM to both real and simulated choice data to perform principled exploratory analyses
  for the presence of choice set effects.
