abstract: Making sense of Wasserstein distances between discrete measures in high-dimensional
  settings remains a challenge. Recent work has advocated a two-step approach to improve
  robustness and facilitate the computation of optimal transport, using for instance
  projections on random real lines, or a preliminary quantization of the measures
  to reduce the size of their support. We propose in this work a “max-min” robust
  variant of the Wasserstein distance by considering the maximal possible distance
  that can be realized between two measures, assuming they can be projected orthogonally
  on a lower k-dimensional subspace. Alternatively, we show that the corresponding
  “min-max” OT problem has a tight convex relaxation which can be cast as that of
  finding an optimal transport plan with a low transportation cost, where the cost
  is alternatively defined as the sum of the k largest eigenvalues of the second order
  moment matrix of the displacements (or matchings) corresponding to that plan (the
  usual OT definition only considers the trace of that matrix). We show that both
  quantities inherit several favorable properties from the OT geometry. We propose
  two algorithms to compute the latter formulation using entropic regularization,
  and illustrate the interest of this approach empirically.
