abstract: Mesh models are a promising approach for encoding the structure of 3D objects.
  Current mesh reconstruction systems predict uniformly distributed vertex locations
  of a predetermined graph through a series of graph convolutions, leading to compromises
  with respect to performance or resolution. In this paper, we argue that the graph
  representation of geometric objects allows for additional structure, which should
  be leveraged for enhanced reconstruction. Thus, we propose a system which properly
  benefits from the advantages of the geometric structure of graph-encoded objects
  by introducing (1) a graph convolutional update preserving vertex information; (2)
  an adaptive splitting heuristic allowing detail to emerge; and (3) a training objective
  operating both on the local surfaces defined by vertices as well as the global structure
  defined by the mesh. Our proposed method is evaluated on the task of 3D object reconstruction
  from images with the ShapeNet dataset, where we demonstrate state of the art performance,
  both visually and numerically, while having far smaller space requirements by generating
  adaptive meshes.
