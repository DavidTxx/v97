abstract: Many real-world decision problems are characterized by multiple conflicting
  objectives which must be balanced based on their relative importance. In the dynamic
  weights setting the relative importance changes over time and specialized algorithms
  that deal with such change, such as a tabular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm
  by Natarajan and Tadepalli (2005), are required. However, this earlier work is not
  feasible for RL settings that necessitate the use of function approximators. We
  generalize across weight changes and high-dimensional inputs by proposing a multi-objective
  Q-network whose outputs are conditioned on the relative importance of objectives
  and we introduce Diverse Experience Replay (DER) to counter the inherent non-stationarity
  of the Dynamic Weights setting. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation
  and compare our methods to adapted algorithms from Deep Multi-Task/Multi-Objective
  Reinforcement Learning and show that our proposed network in combination with DER
  dominates these adapted algorithms across weight change scenarios and problem domains.
