abstract: Constructing fast numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs)
  is crucial for many scientific disciplines. A leading technique for solving large-scale
  PDEs is using multigrid methods. At the core of a multigrid solver is the prolongation
  matrix, which relates between different scales of the problem. This matrix is strongly
  problem-dependent, and its optimal construction is critical to the efficiency of
  the solver. In practice, however, devising multigrid algorithms for new problems
  often poses formidable challenges. In this paper we propose a framework for learning
  multigrid solvers. Our method learns a (single) mapping from discretized PDEs to
  prolongation operators for a broad class of 2D diffusion problems. We train a neural
  network once for the entire class of PDEs, using an efficient and unsupervised loss
  function. Our tests demonstrate improved convergence rates compared to the widely
  used Black-Box multigrid scheme, suggesting that our method successfully learned
  rules for constructing prolongation matrices.
