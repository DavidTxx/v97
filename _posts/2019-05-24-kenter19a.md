abstract: The prosodic aspects of speech signals produced by current text-to-speech
  systems are typically averaged over training material, and as such lack the variety
  and liveliness found in natural speech. To avoid monotony and averaged prosody contours,
  it is desirable to have a way of modeling the variation in the prosodic aspects
  of speech, so audio signals can be synthesized in multiple ways for a given text.
  We present a new, hierarchically structured conditional variational auto-encoder
  to generate prosodic features (fundamental frequency, energy and duration) suitable
  for use with a vocoder or a generative model like WaveNet. At inference time, an
  embedding representing the prosody of a sentence may be sampled from the variational
  layer to allow for prosodic variation. To efficiently capture the hierarchical nature
  of the linguistic input (words, syllables and phones), both the encoder and decoder
  parts of the auto-encoder are hierarchical, in line with the linguistic structure,
  with layers being clocked dynamically at the respective rates. We show in our experiments
  that our dynamic hierarchical network outperforms a non-hierarchical state-of-the-art
  baseline, and, additionally, that prosody transfer across sentences is possible
  by employing the prosody embedding of one sentence to generate the speech signal
  of another.
