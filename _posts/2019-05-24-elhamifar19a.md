abstract: We develop and analyze a novel utility function and a fast optimization
  algorithm for subset selection in sequential data that incorporates the dynamic
  model of data. We propose a cardinality-constrained sequential facility location
  function that finds a fixed number of representatives, where the sequence of representatives
  is compatible with the dynamic model and well encodes the data. As maximizing this
  new objective function is NP-hard, we develop a fast greedy algorithm based on submodular
  maximization. Unlike the conventional facility location, the computation of the
  marginal gain in our case cannot be done by operations on each item independently.
  We exploit the sequential structure of the problem and develop an efficient dynamic
  programming-based algorithm that computes the marginal gain exactly. We investigate
  conditions on the dynamic model, under which our utility function is ($\epsilon$-approximately)
  submodualr, hence, the greedy algorithm comes with performance guarantees. By experiments
  on synthetic data and the problem of procedure learning from instructional videos,
  we show that our framework significantly improves the computational time, achieves
  better objective function values and obtains more coherent summaries.
