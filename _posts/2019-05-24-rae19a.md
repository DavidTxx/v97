abstract: There has been a recent trend in training neural networks to replace data
  structures that have been crafted by hand, with an aim for faster execution, better
  accuracy, or greater compression. In this setting, a neural data structure is instantiated
  by training a network over many epochs of its inputs until convergence. In applications
  where inputs arrive at high throughput, or are ephemeral, training a network from
  scratch is not practical. This motivates the need for few-shot neural data structures.
  In this paper we explore the learning of approximate set membership over a set of
  data in one-shot via meta-learning. We propose a novel memory architecture, the
  Neural Bloom Filter, which is able to achieve significant compression gains over
  classical Bloom Filters and existing memory-augmented neural networks.
