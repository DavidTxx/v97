abstract: Current saliency map interpretations for neural networks generally rely
  on two key assumptions. First, they use first-order approximations of the loss function,
  neglecting higher-order terms such as the loss curvature. Second, they evaluate
  each featureâ€™s importance in isolation, ignoring feature interdependencies. This
  work studies the effect of relaxing these two assumptions. First, we characterize
  a closed-form formula for the input Hessian matrix of a deep ReLU network. Using
  this formula, we show that, for classification problems with many classes, if a
  prediction has high probability then including the Hessian term has a small impact
  on the interpretation. We prove this result by demonstrating that these conditions
  cause the Hessian matrix to be approximately rank one and its leading eigenvector
  to be almost parallel to the gradient of the loss. We empirically validate this
  theory by interpreting ImageNet classifiers. Second, we incorporate feature interdependencies
  by calculating the importance of group-features using a sparsity regularization
  term. We use an L0 - L1 relaxation technique along with proximal gradient descent
  to efficiently compute group-feature importance values. Our empirical results show
  that our method significantly improves deep learning interpretations.
