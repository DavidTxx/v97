abstract: This paper addresses the challenging problem of retrieval and matching of
  graph structured objects, and makes two key contributions. First, we demonstrate
  how Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which have emerged as an effective model for various
  supervised prediction problems defined on structured data, can be trained to produce
  embedding of graphs in vector spaces that enables efficient similarity reasoning.
  Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching Network model that, given a pair of graphs
  as input, computes a similarity score between them by jointly reasoning on the pair
  through a new cross-graph attention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our models on different domains including the challenging problem
  of control-flow graph based function similarity search that plays an important role
  in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental analysis
  demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in the context
  of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain specific baseline systems
  that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.
