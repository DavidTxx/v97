abstract: Neural networks are difficult to interpret and debug. We introduce testing
  techniques for neural networks that can discover errors occurring only for rare
  inputs. Specifically, we develop coverage-guided fuzzing (CGF) methods for neural
  networks. In CGF, random mutations of inputs are guided by a coverage metric toward
  the goal of satisfying user-specified constraints. We describe how approximate nearest
  neighbor (ANN) algorithms can provide this coverage metric for neural networks.
  We then combine these methods with techniques for property-based testing (PBT).
  In PBT, one asserts properties that a function should satisfy and the system automatically
  generates tests exercising those properties. We then apply this system to practical
  goals including (but not limited to) surfacing broken loss functions in popular
  GitHub repositories and making performance improvements to TensorFlow. Finally,
  we release an open source library called TensorFuzz that implements the described
  techniques.
