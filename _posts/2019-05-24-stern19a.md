abstract: 'We present the Insertion Transformer, an iterative, partially autoregressive
  model for sequence generation based on insertion operations. Unlike typical autoregressive
  models which rely on a fixed, often left-to-right ordering of the output, our approach
  accommodates arbitrary orderings by allowing for tokens to be inserted anywhere
  in the sequence during decoding. This flexibility confers a number of advantages:
  for instance, not only can our model be trained to follow specific orderings such
  as left-to-right generation or a binary tree traversal, but it can also be trained
  to maximize entropy over all valid insertions for robustness. In addition, our model
  seamlessly accommodates both fully autoregressive generation (one insertion at a
  time) and partially autoregressive generation (simultaneous insertions at multiple
  locations). We validate our approach by analyzing its performance on the WMT 2014
  English-German machine translation task under various settings for training and
  decoding. We find that the Insertion Transformer outperforms many prior non-autoregressive
  approaches to translation at comparable or better levels of parallelism, and successfully
  recovers the performance of the original Transformer while requiring only logarithmically
  many iterations during decoding.'
