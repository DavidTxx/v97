abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) provides an elegant framework for recovering sparse
  signals from compressed measurements. For example, CS can exploit the structure
  of natural images and recover an image from only a few random measurements. Unlike
  popular autoencoding models, reconstruction in CS is posed as an optimisation problem
  that is separate from sensing. CS is flexible and data efficient, but its application
  has been restricted by the strong assumption of sparsity and costly reconstruction
  process. A recent approach that combines CS with neural network generators has removed
  the constraint of sparsity, but reconstruction remains slow. Here we propose a novel
  framework that significantly improves both the performance and speed of signal recovery
  by jointly training a generator and the optimisation process for reconstruction
  via meta-learning. We explore training the measurements with different objectives,
  and derive a family of models based on minimising measurement errors. We show that
  Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) can be viewed as a special case in this family
  of models. Borrowing insights from the CS perspective, we develop a novel way of
  improving GANs using gradient information from the discriminator.
