abstract: Entropy regularization is commonly used to improve policy optimization in
  reinforcement learning. It is believed to help with exploration by encouraging the
  selection of more stochastic policies. In this work, we analyze this claim using
  new visualizations of the optimization landscape based on randomly perturbing the
  loss function. We first show that even with access to the exact gradient, policy
  optimization is difficult due to the geometry of the objective function. We then
  qualitatively show that in some environments, a policy with higher entropy can make
  the optimization landscape smoother, thereby connecting local optima and enabling
  the use of larger learning rates. This paper presents new tools for understanding
  the optimization landscape, shows that policy entropy serves as a regularizer, and
  highlights the challenge of designing general-purpose policy optimization algorithms.
