abstract: Neural networks with a large number of parameters admit a mean-field description,
  which has recently served as a theoretical explanation for the favorable training
  properties of models with a large number of parameters. In this regime, gradient
  descent obeys a deterministic partial differential equation (PDE) that converges
  to a globally optimal solution for networks with a single hidden layer under appropriate
  assumptions. In this work, we propose a non-local mass transport dynamics that leads
  to a modified PDE with the same minimizer. We implement this non-local dynamics
  as a stochastic neuronal birth/death process and we prove that it accelerates the
  rate of convergence in the mean-field limit. We subsequently realize this PDE with
  two classes of numerical schemes that converge to the mean-field equation, each
  of which can easily be implemented for neural networks with finite numbers of parameters.
  We illustrate our algorithms with two models to provide intuition for the mechanism
  through which convergence is accelerated.
