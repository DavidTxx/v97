abstract: Efficient exploration is an unsolved problem in Reinforcement Learning which
  is usually addressed by reactively rewarding the agent for fortuitously encountering
  novel situations. This paper introduces an efficient <em>active</em> exploration
  algorithm, Model-Based Active eXploration (MAX), which uses an ensemble of forward
  models to plan to observe novel events. This is carried out by optimizing agent
  behaviour with respect to a measure of novelty derived from the Bayesian perspective
  of exploration, which is estimated using the disagreement between the futures predicted
  by the ensemble members. We show empirically that in semi-random discrete environments
  where directed exploration is critical to make progress, MAX is at least an order
  of magnitude more efficient than strong baselines. MAX scales to high-dimensional
  continuous environments where it builds task-agnostic models that can be used for
  any downstream task.
