abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have received considerable attention, since
  they allow us to learn expressive neural density estimators effectively and efficiently.
  However, learning and inference in VAEs is still problematic due to the sensitive
  interplay between the generative model and the inference network. Since these problems
  become generally more severe in high dimensions, we propose a novel hierarchical
  mixture model over low-dimensional VAE experts. Our model decomposes the overall
  learning problem into many smaller problems, which are coordinated by the hierarchical
  mixture, represented by a sum-product network. In experiments we show that our models
  outperform classical VAEs on almost all of our experimental benchmarks. Moreover,
  we show that our model is highly data efficient and degrades very gracefully in
  extremely low data regimes.ow data regimes.
