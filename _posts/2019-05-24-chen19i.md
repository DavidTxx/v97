abstract: Adversarial domain adaptation has made remarkable advances in learning transferable
  representations for knowledge transfer across domains. While adversarial learning
  strengthens the feature transferability which the community focuses on, its impact
  on the feature discriminability has not been fully explored. In this paper, a series
  of experiments based on spectral analysis of the feature representations have been
  conducted, revealing an unexpected deterioration of the discriminability while learning
  transferable features adversarially. Our key finding is that the eigenvectors with
  the largest singular values will dominate the feature transferability. As a consequence,
  the transferability is enhanced at the expense of over penalization of other eigenvectors
  that embody rich structures crucial for discriminability. Towards this problem,
  we present Batch Spectral Penalization (BSP), a general approach to penalizing the
  largest singular values so that other eigenvectors can be relatively strengthened
  to boost the feature discriminability. Experiments show that the approach significantly
  improves upon representative adversarial domain adaptation methods to yield state
  of the art results.
