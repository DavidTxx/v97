abstract: We provide the first importance sampling variants of variance reduced algorithms
  for empirical risk minimization with non-convex loss functions. In particular, we
  analyze non-convex versions of \texttt{SVRG}, \texttt{SAGA} and \texttt{SARAH}.
  Our methods have the capacity to speed up the training process by an order of magnitude
  compared to the state of the art on real datasets. Moreover, we also improve upon
  current mini-batch analysis of these methods by proposing importance sampling for
  minibatches in this setting. Surprisingly, our approach can in some regimes lead
  to superlinear speedup with respect to the minibatch size, which is not usually
  present in stochastic optimization. All the above results follow from a general
  analysis of the methods which works with <em>arbitrary sampling</em>, i.e., fully
  general randomized strategy for the selection of subsets of examples to be sampled
  in each iteration. Finally, we also perform a novel importance sampling analysis
  of \texttt{SARAH} in the convex setting.
