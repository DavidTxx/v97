abstract: The Wasserstein distance serves as a loss function for unsupervised learning
  which depends on the choice of a ground metric on sample space. We propose to use
  the Wasserstein distance itself as the ground metric on the sample space of images.
  This ground metric is known as an effective distance for image retrieval, that correlates
  with human perception. We derive the Wasserstein ground metric on pixel space and
  define a Riemannian Wasserstein gradient penalty to be used in the Wasserstein Generative
  Adversarial Network (WGAN) framework. The new gradient penalty is computed efficiently
  via convolutions on the $L^2$ gradients with negligible additional computational
  cost. The new formulation is more robust to the natural variability of the data
  and provides for a more continuous discriminator in sample space.
