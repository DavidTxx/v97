abstract: Advanced methods of applying deep learning to structured data such as graphs
  have been proposed in recent years. In particular, studies have focused on generalizing
  convolutional neural networks to graph data, which includes redefining the convolution
  and the downsampling (pooling) operations for graphs. The method of generalizing
  the convolution operation to graphs has been proven to improve performance and is
  widely used. However, the method of applying downsampling to graphs is still difficult
  to perform and has room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph pooling
  method based on self-attention. Self-attention using graph convolution allows our
  pooling method to consider both node features and graph topology. To ensure a fair
  comparison, the same training procedures and model architectures were used for the
  existing pooling methods and our method. The experimental results demonstrate that
  our method achieves superior graph classification performance on the benchmark datasets
  using a reasonable number of parameters.
