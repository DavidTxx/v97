abstract: Adaptive data analysis is frequently criticized for its pessimistic generalization
  guarantees. The source of these pessimistic bounds is a model that permits arbitrary,
  possibly adversarial analysts that optimally use information to bias results. While
  being a central issue in the field, still lacking are notions of natural analysts
  that allow for more optimistic bounds faithful to the reality that typical analysts
  aren’t adversarial. In this work, we propose notions of natural analysts that smoothly
  interpolate between the optimal non-adaptive bounds and the best-known adaptive
  generalization bounds. To accomplish this, we model the analyst’s knowledge as evolving
  according to the rules of an unknown dynamical system that takes in revealed information
  and outputs new statistical queries to the data. This allows us to restrict the
  analyst through different natural control-theoretic notions. One such notion corresponds
  to a recency bias, formalizing an inability to arbitrarily use distant information.
  Another complementary notion formalizes an anchoring bias, a tendency to weight
  initial information more strongly. Both notions come with quantitative parameters
  that smoothly interpolate between the non-adaptive case and the fully adaptive case,
  allowing for a rich spectrum of intermediate analysts that are neither non-adaptive
  nor adversarial. Natural not only from a cognitive perspective, we show that our
  notions also capture standard optimization methods, like gradient descent in various
  settings. This gives a new interpretation to the fact that gradient descent tends
  to overfit much less than its adaptive nature might suggest.
