abstract: The problem of explaining the behavior of deep neural networks has recently
  gained a lot of attention. While several attribution methods have been proposed,
  most come without strong theoretical foundations, which raises questions about their
  reliability. On the other hand, the literature on cooperative game theory suggests
  Shapley values as a unique way of assigning relevance scores such that certain desirable
  properties are satisfied. Unfortunately, the exact evaluation of Shapley values
  is prohibitively expensive, exponential in the number of input features. In this
  work, by leveraging recent results on uncertainty propagation, we propose a novel,
  polynomial-time approximation of Shapley values in deep neural networks. We show
  that our method produces significantly better approximations of Shapley values than
  existing state-of-the-art attribution methods.
