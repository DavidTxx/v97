abstract: We introduce a new model for online ranking in which the click probability
  factors into an examination and attractiveness function and the attractiveness function
  is a linear function of a feature vector and an unknown parameter. Only relatively
  mild assumptions are made on the examination function. A novel algorithm for this
  setup is analysed, showing that the dependence on the number of items is replaced
  by a dependence on the dimension, allowing the new algorithm to handle a large number
  of items. When reduced to the orthogonal case, the regret of the algorithm improves
  on the state-of-the-art.
