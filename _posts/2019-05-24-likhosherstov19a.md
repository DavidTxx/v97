abstract: We call an Ising model tractable when it is possible to compute its partition
  function value (statistical inference) in polynomial time. The tractability also
  implies an ability to sample configurations of this model in polynomial time. The
  notion of tractability extends the basic case of planar zero-field Ising models.
  Our starting point is to describe algorithms for the basic case, computing partition
  function and sampling efficiently. Then, we extend our tractable inference and sampling
  algorithms to models whose triconnected components are either planar or graphs of
  $O(1)$ size. In particular, it results in a polynomial-time inference and sampling
  algorithms for $K_{33}$ (minor)-free topologies of zero-field Ising modelsâ€”a generalization
  of planar graphs with a potentially unbounded genus.
