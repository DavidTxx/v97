abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning an unknown, smooth probability
  function via point-wise Bernoulli tests. We provide a scalable algorithm for efficiently
  solving this problem with rigorous guarantees. In particular, we prove the convergence
  rate of our posterior update rule to the true probability function in L2-norm. Moreover,
  we allow the Bernoulli tests to depend on contextual features, and provide a modified
  inference engine with provable guarantees for this novel setting. Numerical results
  show that the empirical convergence rates match the theory, and illustrate the superiority
  of our approach in handling contextual features over the state-of-the-art.
