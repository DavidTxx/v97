abstract: We consider the transfer of experience samples in reinforcement learning.
  Most of the previous works in this context focused on value-based settings, where
  transferring instances conveniently reduces to the transfer of (s,a,sâ€™,r) tuples.
  In this paper, we consider the more complex case of reusing samples in policy search
  methods, in which the agent is required to transfer entire trajectories between
  environments with different transition models. By leveraging ideas from multiple
  importance sampling, we propose robust gradient estimators that effectively achieve
  this goal, along with several techniques to reduce their variance. In the case where
  the transition models are known, we theoretically establish the robustness to the
  negative transfer for our estimators. In the case of unknown models, we propose
  a method to efficiently estimate them when the target task belongs to a finite set
  of possible tasks and when it belongs to some reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
  We provide empirical results to show the effectiveness of our estimators.
