abstract: We introduce HyperGAN, a generative model that learns to generate all the
  parameters of a deep neural network. HyperGAN first transforms low dimensional noise
  into a latent space, which can be sampled from to obtain diverse, performant sets
  of parameters for a target architecture. We utilize an architecture that bears resemblance
  to generative adversarial networks, but we evaluate the likelihood of generated
  samples with a classification loss. This is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence
  between the distribution of generated parameters, and the unknown true parameter
  distribution. We apply HyperGAN to classification, showing that HyperGAN can learn
  to generate parameters which solve the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with competitive
  performance to fully supervised learning, while also generating a rich distribution
  of effective parameters. We also show that HyperGAN can also provide better uncertainty
  estimates than standard ensembles. This is evidenced by the ability of HyperGAN-generated
  ensembles to detect out of distribution data as well as adversarial examples.
