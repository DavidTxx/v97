abstract: Interpretable modeling of heterogeneous data channels is essential in medical
  applications, for example when jointly analyzing clinical scores and medical images.
  Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are powerful generative models that learn representations
  of complex data. The flexibility of VAE may come at the expense of lack of interpretability
  in describing the joint relationship between heterogeneous data. To tackle this
  problem, in this work we extend the variational framework of VAE to bring parsimony
  and interpretability when jointly account for latent relationships across multiple
  channels. In the latent space, this is achieved by constraining the variational
  distribution of each channel to a common target prior. Parsimonious latent representations
  are enforced by variational dropout. Experiments on synthetic data show that our
  model correctly identifies the prescribed latent dimensions and data relationships
  across multiple testing scenarios. When applied to imaging and clinical data, our
  method allows to identify the joint effect of age and pathology in describing clinical
  condition in a large scale clinical cohort.
