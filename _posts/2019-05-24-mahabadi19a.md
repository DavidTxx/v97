abstract: “Composable core-sets” are an efficient framework for solving optimization
  problems in massive data models. In this work, we consider efficient construction
  of composable core-sets for the determinant maximization problem. This can also
  be cast as the MAP inference task for “determinantal point processes", that have
  recently gained a lot of interest for modeling diversity and fairness. The problem
  was recently studied in \cite{indyk2018composable}, where they designed composable
  core-sets with the optimal approximation bound of $O(k)^k$. On the other hand, the
  more practical “Greedy" algorithm has been previously used in similar contexts.
  In this work, first we provide a theoretical approximation guarantee of $C^{k^2}$
  for the Greedy algorithm in the context of composable core-sets; Further, we propose
  to use a “Local Search" based algorithm that while being still practical, achieves
  a nearly optimal approximation bound of $O(k)^{2k}$; Finally, we implement all three
  algorithms and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on standard data
  sets.
