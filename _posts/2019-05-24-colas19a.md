abstract: In open-ended environments, autonomous learning agents must set their own
  goals and build their own curriculum through an intrinsically motivated exploration.
  They may consider a large diversity of goals, aiming to discover what is controllable
  in their environments, and what is not. Because some goals might prove easy and
  some impossible, agents must actively select which goal to practice at any moment,
  to maximize their overall mastery on the set of learnable goals. This paper proposes
  CURIOUS , an algorithm that leverages 1) a modular Universal Value Function Approximator
  with hindsight learning to achieve a diversity of goals of different kinds within
  a unique policy and 2) an automated curriculum learning mechanism that biases the
  attention of the agent towards goals maximizing the absolute learning progress.
  Agents focus sequentially on goals of increasing complexity, and focus back on goals
  that are being forgotten. Experiments conducted in a new modular-goal robotic environment
  show the resulting developmental self-organization of a learning curriculum, and
  demonstrate properties of robustness to distracting goals, forgetting and changes
  in body properties.
