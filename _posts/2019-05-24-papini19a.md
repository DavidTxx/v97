abstract: Policy Search (PS) is an effective approach to Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  for solving control tasks with continuous state-action spaces. In this paper, we
  address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in PS by proposing an approach based
  on Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty. We cast the PS problem as a suitable Multi
  Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, defined over the policy parameter space, and we propose
  a class of algorithms that effectively exploit the problem structure, by leveraging
  Multiple Importance Sampling to perform an off-policy estimation of the expected
  return. We show that the regret of the proposed approach is bounded by $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
  for both discrete and continuous parameter spaces. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms
  on tasks of varying difficulty, comparing them with existing MAB and RL algorithms.
