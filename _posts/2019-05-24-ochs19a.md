abstract: The Conditional Gradient Method is generalized to a class of non-smooth
  non-convex optimization problems with many applications in machine learning. The
  proposed algorithm iterates by minimizing so-called model functions over the constraint
  set. Complemented with an Armijo line search procedure, we prove that subsequences
  converge to a stationary point. The abstract framework of model functions provides
  great flexibility in the design of concrete algorithms. As special cases, for example,
  we develop an algorithm for additive composite problems and an algorithm for non-linear
  composite problems which leads to a Gauss-Newton-type algorithm. Both instances
  are novel in non-smooth non-convex optimization and come with numerous applications
  in machine learning. We perform an experiment on a non-linear robust regression
  problem and discuss the flexibility of the proposed framework in several matrix
  factorization formulations.
