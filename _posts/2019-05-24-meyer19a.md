abstract: We propose a novel combination of optimization tools with learning theory
  bounds in order to analyze the sample complexity of optimal kernel sum classifiers.
  This contrasts the typical learning theoretic results which hold for all (potentially
  suboptimal) classifiers. Our work also justifies assumptions made in prior work
  on multiple kernel learning. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also provide a new
  form of Rademacher complexity for hypothesis classes containing only optimal classifiers.
