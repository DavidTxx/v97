abstract: There is a rising interest in studying the robustness of deep neural network
  classifiers against adversaries, with both advanced attack and defence techniques
  being actively developed. However, most recent work focuses on discriminative classifiers,
  which only model the conditional distribution of the labels given the inputs. In
  this paper, we propose and investigate the deep Bayes classifier, which improves
  classical naive Bayes with conditional deep generative models. We further develop
  detection methods for adversarial examples, which reject inputs with low likelihood
  under the generative model. Experimental results suggest that deep Bayes classifiers
  are more robust than deep discriminative classifiers, and that the proposed detection
  methods are effective against many recently proposed attacks.
