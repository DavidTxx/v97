abstract: Suppose that we wish to estimate a user’s preference vector $w$ from paired
  comparisons of the form “does user $w$ prefer item $p$ or item $q$?,” where both
  the user and items are embedded in a low-dimensional Euclidean space with distances
  that reflect user and item similarities. Such observations arise in numerous settings,
  including psychometrics and psychology experiments, search tasks, advertising, and
  recommender systems. In such tasks, queries can be extremely costly and subject
  to varying levels of response noise; thus, we aim to actively choose pairs that
  are most informative given the results of previous comparisons. We provide new theoretical
  insights into the benefits and challenges of greedy information maximization in
  this setting, and develop two novel strategies that maximize lower bounds on information
  gain and are simpler to analyze and compute respectively. We use simulated responses
  from a real-world dataset to validate our strategies through their similar performance
  to greedy information maximization, and their superior preference estimation over
  state-of-the-art selection methods as well as random queries.
