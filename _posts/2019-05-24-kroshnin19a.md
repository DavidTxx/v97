abstract: We study the complexity of approximating the Wasserstein barycenter of $m$
  discrete measures, or histograms of size $n$, by contrasting two alternative approaches
  that use entropic regularization. The first approach is based on the Iterative Bregman
  Projections (IBP) algorithm for which our novel analysis gives a complexity bound
  proportional to ${mn^2}/{\varepsilon^2}$ to approximate the original non-regularized
  barycenter. On the other hand, using an approach based on accelerated gradient descent,
  we obtain a complexity proportional toÂ ${mn^{2}}/{\varepsilon}$. As a byproduct,
  we show that the regularization parameter in both approaches has to be proportional
  to $\varepsilon$, which causes instability of both algorithms when the desired accuracy
  is high. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel proximal-IBP algorithm, which
  can be seen as a proximal gradient method, which uses IBP on each iteration to make
  a proximal step. We also consider the question of scalability of these algorithms
  using approaches from distributed optimization and show that the first algorithm
  can be implemented in a centralized distributed setting (master/slave), while the
  second one is amenable to a more general decentralized distributed setting with
  an arbitrary network topology.
