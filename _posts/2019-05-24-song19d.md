abstract: 'Pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT \citep{devlin2018bert}, have achieved
  great success in language understanding by transferring knowledge from rich-resource
  pre-training task to the low/zero-resource downstream tasks. Inspired by the success
  of BERT, we propose MAsked Sequence to Sequence pre-training (MASS) for the encoder-decoder
  based language generation tasks. MASS adopts the encoder-decoder framework to reconstruct
  a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence: its encoder takes
  a sentence with randomly masked fragment (several consecutive tokens) as input,
  and its decoder tries to predict this masked fragment. In this way, MASS can jointly
  train the encoder and decoder to develop the capability of representation extraction
  and language modeling. By further fine-tuning on a variety of zero/low-resource
  language generation tasks, including neural machine translation, text summarization
  and conversational response generation (3 tasks and totally 8 datasets), MASS achieves
  significant improvements over the baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training
  methods. Especially, we achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy (30.02 in terms of
  BLEU score) on the unsupervised English-French translation, even beating the early
  attention-based supervised model \citep{bahdanau2015neural}.'
