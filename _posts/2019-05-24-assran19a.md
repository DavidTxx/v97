abstract: Distributed data-parallel algorithms aim to accelerate the training of deep
  neural networks by parallelizing the computation of large mini-batch gradient updates
  across multiple nodes. Approaches that synchronize nodes using exact distributed
  averaging (e.g., via AllReduce) are sensitive to stragglers and communication delays.
  The PushSum gossip algorithm is robust to these issues, but only performs approximate
  distributed averaging. This paper studies Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP), which
  combines PushSum with stochastic gradient updates. We prove that SGP converges to
  a stationary point of smooth, non-convex objectives at the same sub-linear rate
  as SGD, and that all nodes achieve consensus. We empirically validate the performance
  of SGP on image classification (ResNet-50, ImageNet) and machine translation (Transformer,
  WMTâ€™16 En-De) workloads.
