abstract: Despite its empirical success and recent theoretical progress, there generally
  lacks a quantitative analysis of the effect of batch normalization (BN) on the convergence
  and stability of gradient descent. In this paper, we provide such an analysis on
  the simple problem of ordinary least squares (OLS), where the precise dynamical
  properties of gradient descent (GD) is completely known, thus allowing us to isolate
  and compare the additional effects of BN. More precisely, we show that unlike GD,
  gradient descent with BN (BNGD) converges for arbitrary learning rates for the weights,
  and the convergence remains linear under mild conditions. Moreover, we quantify
  two different sources of acceleration of BNGD over GD â€“ one due to over-parameterization
  which improves the effective condition number and another due having a large range
  of learning rates giving rise to fast descent. These phenomena set BNGD apart from
  GD and could account for much of its robustness properties. These findings are confirmed
  quantitatively by numerical experiments, which further show that many of the uncovered
  properties of BNGD in OLS are also observed qualitatively in more complex supervised
  learning problems.
