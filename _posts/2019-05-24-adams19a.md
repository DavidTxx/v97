abstract: Measurement error in observational datasets can lead to systematic bias
  in inferences based on these datasets. As studies based on observational data are
  increasingly used to inform decisions with real-world impact, it is critical that
  we develop a robust set of techniques for analyzing and adjusting for these biases.
  In this paper we present a method for estimating the distribution of an outcome
  given a binary exposure that is subject to underreporting. Our method is based on
  a missing data view of the measurement error problem, where the true exposure is
  treated as a latent variable that is marginalized out of a joint model. We prove
  three different conditions under which the outcome distribution can still be identified
  from data containing only error-prone observations of the exposure. We demonstrate
  this method on synthetic data and analyze its sensitivity to near violations of
  the identifiability conditions. Finally, we use this method to estimate the effects
  of maternal smoking and heroin use during pregnancy on childhood obesity, two import
  problems from public health. Using the proposed method, we estimate these effects
  using only subject-reported drug use data and refine the range of estimates generated
  by a sensitivity analysis-based approach. Further, the estimates produced by our
  method are consistent with existing literature on both the effects of maternal smoking
  and the rate at which subjects underreport smoking.
