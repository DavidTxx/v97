abstract: We propose a general framework for denoising high-dimensional measurements
  which requires no prior on the signal, no estimate of the noise, and no clean training
  data. The only assumption is that the noise exhibits statistical independence across
  different dimensions of the measurement, while the true signal exhibits some correlation.
  For a broad class of functions (“$\mathcal{J}$-invariant”), it is then possible
  to estimate the performance of a denoiser from noisy data alone. This allows us
  to calibrate $\mathcal{J}$-invariant versions of any parameterised denoising algorithm,
  from the single hyperparameter of a median filter to the millions of weights of
  a deep neural network. We demonstrate this on natural image and microscopy data,
  where we exploit noise independence between pixels, and on single-cell gene expression
  data, where we exploit independence between detections of individual molecules.
  This framework generalizes recent work on training neural nets from noisy images
  and on cross-validation for matrix factorization.
