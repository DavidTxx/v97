abstract: Solving for adversarial examples with projected gradient descent has been
  demonstrated to be highly effective in fooling the neural network based classifiers.
  However, in the black-box setting, the attacker is limited only to the query access
  to the network and solving for a successful adversarial example becomes much more
  difficult. To this end, recent methods aim at estimating the true gradient signal
  based on the input queries but at the cost of excessive queries. We propose an efficient
  discrete surrogate to the optimization problem which does not require estimating
  the gradient and consequently becomes free of the first order update hyperparameters
  to tune. Our experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet show the state of the art black-box
  attack performance with significant reduction in the required queries compared to
  a number of recently proposed methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/parsimonious-blackbox-attack.
