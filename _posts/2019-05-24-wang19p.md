abstract: The gradient of a deep neural network (DNN) w.r.t. the input provides information
  that can be used to explain the output prediction in terms of the input features
  and has been widely studied to assist in interpreting DNNs. In a linear model (i.e.,
  g(x) = wx + b), the gradient corresponds to the weights w. Such a model can reasonably
  locally-linearly approximate a smooth nonlinear DNN, and hence the weights of this
  local model are the gradient. The bias b, however, is usually overlooked in attribution
  methods. In this paper, we observe that since the bias in a DNN also has a non-negligible
  contribution to the correctness of predictions, it can also play a significant role
  in understanding DNN behavior. We propose a backpropagation-type algorithm “bias
  back-propagation (BBp)” that starts at the output layer and iteratively attributes
  the bias of each layer to its input nodes as well as combining the resulting bias
  term of the previous layer. Together with the backpropagation of the gradient generating
  w, we can fully recover the locally linear model g(x) = wx + b. In experiments,
  we show that BBp can generate complementary and highly interpretable explanations.
