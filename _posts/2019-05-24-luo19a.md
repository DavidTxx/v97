abstract: This work presents Dynamic Normalization (DN), which is able to learn arbitrary
  normalization operations for different convolutional layers in a deep ConvNet. Unlike
  existing normalization approaches that predefined computations of the statistics
  (mean and variance), DN learns to estimate them. DN has several appealing benefits.
  First, it adapts to various networks, tasks, and batch sizes. Second, it can be
  easily implemented and trained in a differentiable end-to-end manner with merely
  small number of parameters. Third, its matrix formulation represents a wide range
  of normalization methods, shedding light on analyzing them theoretically. Extensive
  studies show that DN outperforms its counterparts in CIFAR10 and ImageNet.
