abstract: One of the challenges to reinforcement learning (RL) is scalable transferability
  among complex tasks. Incorporating a graphical model (GM), along with the rich family
  of related methods, as a basis for RL frameworks provides potential to address issues
  such as transferability, generalisation and exploration. Here we propose a flexible
  GM-based RL framework which leverages efficient inference procedures to enhance
  generalisation and transfer power. In our proposed transferable and information-based
  graphical model framework ‘TibGM’, we show the equivalence between our mutual information-based
  objective in the GM, and an RL consolidated objective consisting of a standard reward
  maximisation target and a generalisation/transfer objective. In settings where there
  is a sparse or deceptive reward signal, our TibGM framework is flexible enough to
  incorporate exploration bonuses depicting intrinsic rewards. We empirically verify
  improved performance and exploration power.
