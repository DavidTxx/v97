abstract: Normalizing flows are a powerful class of generative models for continuous
  random variables, showing both strong model flexibility and the potential for non-autoregressive
  generation. These benefits are also desired when modeling discrete random variables
  such as text, but directly applying normalizing flows to discrete sequences poses
  significant additional challenges. We propose a VAE-based generative model which
  jointly learns a normalizing flow-based distribution in the latent space and a stochastic
  mapping to an observed discrete space. In this setting, we find that it is crucial
  for the flow-based distribution to be highly multimodal. To capture this property,
  we propose several normalizing flow architectures to maximize model flexibility.
  Experiments consider common discrete sequence tasks of character-level language
  modeling and polyphonic music generation. Our results indicate that an autoregressive
  flow-based model can match the performance of a comparable autoregressive baseline,
  and a non-autoregressive flow-based model can improve generation speed with a penalty
  to performance.
