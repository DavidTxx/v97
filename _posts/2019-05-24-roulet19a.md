abstract: We examine popular gradient-based algorithms for nonlinear control in the
  light of the modern complexity analysis of first-order optimization algorithms.
  The examination reveals that the complexity bounds can be clearly stated in terms
  of calls to a computational oracle related to dynamic programming and implementable
  by gradient back-propagation using machine learning software libraries such as PyTorch
  or TensorFlow. Finally, we propose a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm enjoying
  worst-case complexity bounds and improved convergence behavior in practice. The
  software library based on PyTorch is publicly available.
