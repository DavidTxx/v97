abstract: We investigate conditions under which test statistics exist that can reliably
  detect examples, which have been adversarially manipulated in a white-box attack.
  These statistics can be easily computed and calibrated by randomly corrupting inputs.
  They exploit certain anomalies that adversarial attacks introduce, in particular
  if they follow the paradigm of choosing perturbations optimally under p-norm constraints.
  Access to the log-odds is the only requirement to defend models. We justify our
  approach empirically, but also provide conditions under which detectability via
  the suggested test statistics is guaranteed to be effective. In our experiments,
  we show that it is even possible to correct test time predictions for adversarial
  attacks with high accuracy.
