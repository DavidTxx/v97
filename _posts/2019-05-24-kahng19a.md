abstract: Virtual democracy is an approach to automating decisions, by learning models
  of the preferences of individual people, and, at runtime, aggregating the predicted
  preferences of those people on the dilemma at hand. One of the key questions is
  which aggregation method – or voting rule – to use; we offer a novel statistical
  viewpoint that provides guidance. Specifically, we seek voting rules that are robust
  to prediction errors, in that their output on people’s true preferences is likely
  to coincide with their output on noisy estimates thereof. We prove that the classic
  Borda count rule is robust in this sense, whereas any voting rule belonging to the
  wide family of pairwise-majority consistent rules is not. Our empirical results
  further support, and more precisely measure, the robustness of Borda count.
