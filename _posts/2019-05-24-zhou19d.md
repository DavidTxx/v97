abstract: Numerous empirical evidence has corroborated that the noise plays a crucial
  rule in effective and efficient training of deep neural networks. The theory behind,
  however, is still largely unknown. This paper studies this fundamental problem through
  training a simple two-layer convolutional neural network model. Although training
  such a network requires to solve a non-convex optimization problem with a spurious
  local optimum and a global optimum, we prove that a perturbed gradient descent algorithm
  in conjunction with noise annealing is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum
  in polynomial time with arbitrary initialization. This implies that the noise enables
  the algorithm to efficiently escape from the spurious local optimum. Numerical experiments
  are provided to support our theory.
