abstract: We study Imitation Learning (IL) from Observations alone (ILFO) in large-scale
  MDPs. While most IL algorithms rely on an expert to directly provide actions to
  the learner, in this setting the expert only supplies sequences of observations.
  We design a new model-free algorithm for ILFO, Forward Adversarial Imitation Learning
  (FAIL), which learns a sequence of time-dependent policies by minimizing an Integral
  Probability Metric between the observation distributions of the expert policy and
  the learner. FAIL provably learns a near-optimal policy with a number of samples
  that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique
  observations. The resulting theory extends the domain of provably sample efficient
  learning algorithms beyond existing results that typically only consider tabular
  RL settings or settings that require access to a near-optimal reset distribution.
  We also demonstrate the efficacy ofFAIL on multiple OpenAI Gym control tasks.
