abstract: We study the interplay between surrogate methods for structured prediction
  and techniques from multitask learning designed to leverage relationships between
  surrogate outputs. We propose an efficient algorithm based on trace norm regularization
  which, differently from previous methods, does not require explicit knowledge of
  the coding/decoding functions of the surrogate framework. As a result, our algorithm
  can be applied to the broad class of problems in which the surrogate space is large
  or even infinite dimensional. We study excess risk bounds for trace norm regularized
  structured prediction proving the consistency and learning rates for our estimator.
  We also identify relevant regimes in which our approach can enjoy better generalization
  performance than previous methods. Numerical experiments on ranking problems indicate
  that enforcing low-rank relations among surrogate outputs may indeed provide a significant
  advantage in practice.
