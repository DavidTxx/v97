abstract: The key idea behind the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations
  is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation which
  can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide
  a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common assumptions.
  We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations
  is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the
  data. Then, we train more than $12000$ models covering most prominent methods and
  evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different
  data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties
  “encouraged” by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot
  be identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not
  seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks.
  Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be explicit
  about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete
  benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider
  a reproducible experimental setup covering several data sets.
