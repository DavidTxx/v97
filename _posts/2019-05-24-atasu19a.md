abstract: The Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) is a state-of-the art metric for comparing
  discrete probability distributions, but its high distinguishability comes at a high
  cost in computational complexity. Even though linear-complexity approximation algorithms
  have been proposed to improve its scalability, these algorithms are either limited
  to vector spaces with only a few dimensions or they become ineffective when the
  degree of overlap between the probability distributions is high. We propose novel
  approximation algorithms that overcome both of these limitations, yet still achieve
  linear time complexity. All our algorithms are data parallel, and therefore, we
  can take advantage of massively parallel computing engines, such as Graphics Processing
  Units (GPUs). On the popular text-based 20 Newsgroups dataset, the new algorithms
  are four orders of magnitude faster than a multi-threaded CPU implementation of
  Word Mover’s Distance and match its search accuracy. On MNIST images, the new algorithms
  are four orders of magnitude faster than Cuturi’s GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn’s
  algorithm while offering a slightly higher search accuracy.
