abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms struggle when the reward signal is very
  sparse. In these cases, naive random exploration methods essentially rely on a random
  walk to stumble onto a rewarding state. Recent works utilize intrinsic motivation
  to guide the exploration via generative models, predictive forward models, or discriminative
  modeling of novelty. We propose EMI, which is an exploration method that constructs
  embedding representation of states and actions that does not rely on generative
  decoding of the full observation but extracts predictive signals that can be used
  to guide exploration based on forward prediction in the representation space. Our
  experiments show competitive results on challenging locomotion tasks with continuous
  control and on image-based exploration tasks with discrete actions on Atari. The
  source code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/EMI.
