abstract: We introduce Minimal Achievable Sufficient Statistic (MASS) Learning, a
  machine learning training objective for which the minima are minimal sufficient
  statistics with respect to a class of functions being optimized over (e.g., deep
  networks). In deriving MASS Learning, we also introduce Conserved Differential Information
  (CDI), an information-theoretic quantity that {—} unlike standard mutual information
  {—} can be usefully applied to deterministically-dependent continuous random variables
  like the input and output of a deep network. In a series of experiments, we show
  that deep networks trained with MASS Learning achieve competitive performance on
  supervised learning, regularization, and uncertainty quantification benchmarks.
