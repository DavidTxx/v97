abstract: Generative models have proven to be an outstanding tool for representing
  high-dimensional probability distributions and generating realistic looking images.
  An essential characteristic of generative models is their ability to produce multi-modal
  outputs. However, while training, they are often susceptible to mode collapse, that
  is models are limited in mapping input noise to only a few modes of the true data
  distribution. In this work, we draw inspiration from Determinantal Point Process
  (DPP) to propose an unsupervised penalty loss that alleviates mode collapse while
  producing higher quality samples. DPP is an elegant probabilistic measure used to
  model negative correlations within a subset and hence quantify its diversity. We
  use DPP kernel to model the diversity in real data as well as in synthetic data.
  Then, we devise an objective term that encourages generator to synthesize data with
  a similar diversity to real data. In contrast to previous state-of-the-art generative
  models that tend to use additional trainable parameters or complex training paradigms,
  our method does not change the original training scheme. Embedded in an adversarial
  training and variational autoencoder, our Generative DPP approach shows a consistent
  resistance to mode-collapse on a wide-variety of synthetic data and natural image
  datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA, while outperforming state-of-the-art
  methods for data-efficiency, generation quality, and convergence-time whereas being
  5.8x faster than its closest competitor.
