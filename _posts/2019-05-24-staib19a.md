abstract: 'Adaptive methods such as Adam and RMSProp are widely used in deep learning
  but are not well understood. In this paper, we seek a crisp, clean and precise characterization
  of their behavior in nonconvex settings. To this end, we first provide a novel view
  of adaptive methods as preconditioned SGD, where the preconditioner is estimated
  in an online manner. By studying the preconditioner on its own, we elucidate its
  purpose: it rescales the stochastic gradient noise to be isotropic near stationary
  points, which helps escape saddle points. Furthermore, we show that adaptive methods
  can efficiently estimate the aforementioned preconditioner. By gluing together these
  two components, we provide the first (to our knowledge) second-order convergence
  result for any adaptive method. The key insight from our analysis is that, compared
  to SGD, adaptive methods escape saddle points faster, and can converge faster overall
  to second-order stationary points.'
