abstract: 'Data augmentation, a technique in which a training set is expanded with
  class-preserving transformations, is ubiquitous in modern machine learning pipelines.
  In this paper, we seek to establish a theoretical framework for understanding data
  augmentation. We approach this from two directions: First, we provide a general
  model of augmentation as a Markov process, and show that kernels appear naturally
  with respect to this model, even when we do not employ kernel classification. Next,
  we analyze more directly the effect of augmentation on kernel classifiers, showing
  that data augmentation can be approximated by first-order feature averaging and
  second-order variance regularization components. These frameworks both serve to
  illustrate the ways in which data augmentation affects the downstream learning model,
  and the resulting analyses provide novel connections between prior work in invariant
  kernels, tangent propagation, and robust optimization. Finally, we provide several
  proof-of-concept applications showing that our theory can be useful for accelerating
  machine learning workflows, such as reducing the amount of computation needed to
  train using augmented data, and predicting the utility of a transformation prior
  to training.'
