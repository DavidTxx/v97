abstract: "Machine learning is increasingly targeting areas where input data cannot
  be accurately described by a single vector, but can be modeled instead using the
  more flexible concept of random vectors, namely probability measures or more simply
  point clouds of varying cardinality. Using deep architectures on measures poses,
  however, many challenging issues. Indeed, deep architectures are originally designed
  to handle \ffixed-length vectors, or, using recursive mechanisms, ordered sequences
  thereof. In sharp contrast, measures describe a varying number of weighted observations
  with no particular order. We propose in this work a deep framework designed to handle
  crucial aspects of measures, namely permutation invariances, variations in weights
  and cardinality. Architectures derived from this pipeline can (i) map measures to
  measures - using the concept of push-forward operators; (ii) bridge the gap between
  measures and Euclidean spaces - through integration steps. This allows to design
  discriminative networks (to classify or reduce the dimensionality of input measures),
  generative architectures (to synthesize measures) and recurrent pipelines (to predict
  measure dynamics). We provide a theoretical analysis of these building blocks, review
  our architectures’ approximation abilities and robustness w.r.t. perturbation, and
  try them on various discriminative and generative tasks."
