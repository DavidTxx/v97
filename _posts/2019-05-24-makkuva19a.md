abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a widely popular model for ensemble learning
  and is a basic building block of highly successful modern neural networks as well
  as a component in Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Attention networks. However, present
  algorithms for learning MoE, including the EM algorithm and gradient descent, are
  known to get stuck in local optima. From a theoretical viewpoint, finding an efficient
  and provably consistent algorithm to learn the parameters remains a long standing
  open problem for more than two decades. In this paper, we introduce the first algorithm
  that learns the true parameters of a MoE model for a wide class of non-linearities
  with global consistency guarantees. While existing algorithms jointly or iteratively
  estimate the expert parameters and the gating parameters in the MoE, we propose
  a novel algorithm that breaks the deadlock and can directly estimate the expert
  parameters by sensing its echo in a carefully designed cross-moment tensor between
  the inputs and the output. Once the experts are known, the recovery of gating parameters
  still requires an EM algorithm; however, we show that the EM algorithm for this
  simplified problem, unlike the joint EM algorithm, converges to the true parameters.
  We empirically validate our algorithm on both the synthetic and real data sets in
  a variety of settings, and show superior performance to standard baselines.
