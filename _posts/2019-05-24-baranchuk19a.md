abstract: 'Recently similarity graphs became the leading paradigm for efficient nearest
  neighbor search, outperforming traditional tree-based and LSH-based methods. Similarity
  graphs perform the search via greedy routing: a query traverses the graph and in
  each vertex moves to the adjacent vertex that is the closest to this query. In practice,
  similarity graphs are often susceptible to local minima, when queries do not reach
  its nearest neighbors, getting stuck in suboptimal vertices. In this paper we propose
  to learn the routing function that overcomes local minima via incorporating information
  about the graph global structure. In particular, we augment the vertices of a given
  graph with additional representations that are learned to provide the optimal routing
  from the start vertex to the query nearest neighbor. By thorough experiments, we
  demonstrate that the proposed learnable routing successfully diminishes the local
  minima problem and significantly improves the overall search performance.'
