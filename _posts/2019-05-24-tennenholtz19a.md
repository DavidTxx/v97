abstract: We introduce Act2Vec, a general framework for learning context-based action
  representation for Reinforcement Learning. Representing actions in a vector space
  help reinforcement learning algorithms achieve better performance by grouping similar
  actions and utilizing relations between different actions. We show how prior knowledge
  of an environment can be extracted from demonstrations and injected into action
  vector representations that encode natural compatible behavior. We then use these
  for augmenting state representations as well as improving function approximation
  of Q-values. We visualize and test action embeddings in three domains including
  a drawing task, a high dimensional navigation task, and the large action space domain
  of StarCraft II.
