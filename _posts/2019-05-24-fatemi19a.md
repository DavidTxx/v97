abstract: Many interesting applications of reinforcement learning (RL) involve MDPs
  that include numerous “dead-end" states. Upon reaching a dead-end state, the agent
  continues to interact with the environment in a dead-end trajectory before reaching
  an undesired terminal state, regardless of whatever actions are chosen. The situation
  is even worse when existence of many dead-end states is coupled with distant positive
  rewards from any initial state (we term this as Bridge Effect). Hence, conventional
  exploration techniques often incur prohibitively many training steps before convergence.
  To deal with the bridge effect, we propose a condition for exploration, called security.
  We next establish formal results that translate the security condition into the
  learning problem of an auxiliary value function. This new value function is used
  to cap “any" given exploration policy and is guaranteed to make it secure. As a
  special case, we use this theory and introduce secure random-walk. We next extend
  our results to the deep RL settings by identifying and addressing two main challenges
  that arise. Finally, we empirically compare secure random-walk with standard benchmarks
  in two sets of experiments including the Atari game of Montezuma’s Revenge.
