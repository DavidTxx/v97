abstract: Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) over generalized weighted space is a fundamental
  problem which has many applications in various fields. However, to the best of our
  knowledge, there is no sublinear time solution to this problem. Based on the idea
  of Asymmetric Locality-Sensitive Hashing (ALSH), we introduce a novel spherical
  asymmetric transformation and propose the first two novel weight-oblivious hashing
  schemes SL-ALSH and S2-ALSH accordingly. We further show that both schemes enjoy
  a quality guarantee and can answer the NNS queries in sublinear time. Evaluations
  over three real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the two proposed
  schemes.
