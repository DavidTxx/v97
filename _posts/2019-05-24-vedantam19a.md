abstract: We propose a new class of probabilistic neural-symbolic models, that have
  symbolic functional programs as a latent, stochastic variable. Instantiated in the
  context of visual question answering, our probabilistic formulation offers two key
  conceptual advantages over prior neural-symbolic models for VQA. Firstly, the programs
  generated by our model are more understandable while requiring less number of teaching
  examples. Secondly, we show that one can pose counterfactual scenarios to the model,
  to probe its beliefs on the programs that could lead to a specified answer given
  an image. Our results on the CLEVR and SHAPES datasets verify our hypotheses, showing
  that the model gets better program (and answer) prediction accuracy even in the
  low data regime, and allows one to probe the coherence and consistency of reasoning
  performed.
