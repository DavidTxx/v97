abstract: The formation of a real-world graph typically arises from the highly complex
  interaction of many latent factors. The existing deep learning methods for graph-structured
  data neglect the entanglement of the latent factors, rendering the learned representations
  non-robust and hardly explainable. However, learning representations that disentangle
  the latent factors poses great challenges and remains largely unexplored in the
  literature of graph neural networks. In this paper, we introduce the disentangled
  graph convolutional network (DisenGCN) to learn disentangled node representations.
  In particular, we propose a novel neighborhood routing mechanism, which is capable
  of dynamically identifying the latent factor that may have caused the edge between
  a node and one of its neighbors, and accordingly assigning the neighbor to a channel
  that extracts and convolutes features specific to that factor. We theoretically
  prove the convergence properties of the routing mechanism. Empirical results show
  that our proposed model can achieve significant performance gains, especially when
  the data demonstrate the existence of many entangled factors.
