abstract: We design and study a Contextual Memory Tree (CMT), a learning memory controller
  that inserts new memories into an experience store of unbounded size. It operates
  online and is designed to efficiently query for memories from that store, supporting
  logarithmic time insertion and retrieval operations. Hence CMT can be integrated
  into existing statistical learning algorithms as an augmented memory unit without
  substantially increasing training and inference computation. Furthermore CMT operates
  as a reduction to classification, allowing it to benefit from advances in representation
  or architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of CMT by augmenting existing multi-class
  and multi-label classification algorithms with CMT and observe statistical improvement.
  We also test CMT learning on several image-captioning tasks to demonstrate that
  it performs computationally better than a simple nearest neighbors memory system
  while benefitting from reward learning.
