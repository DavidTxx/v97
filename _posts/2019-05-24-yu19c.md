abstract: For SGD based distributed stochastic optimization, computation complexity,
  measured by the convergence rate in terms of the number of stochastic gradient calls,
  and communication complexity, measured by the number of inter-node communication
  rounds, are two most important performance metrics. The classical data-parallel
  implementation of SGD over N workers can achieve linear speedup of its convergence
  rate but incurs an inter-node communication round at each batch. We study the benefit
  of using dynamically increasing batch sizes in parallel SGD for stochastic non-convex
  optimization by charactering the attained convergence rate and the required number
  of communication rounds. We show that for stochastic non-convex optimization under
  the P-L condition, the classical data-parallel SGD with exponentially increasing
  batch sizes can achieve the fastest known $O(1/(NT))$ convergence with linear speedup
  using only $\log(T)$ communication rounds. For general stochastic non-convex optimization,
  we propose a Catalyst-like algorithm to achieve the fastest known $O(1/\sqrt{NT})$
  convergence with only $O(\sqrt{NT}\log(\frac{T}{N}))$ communication rounds.
