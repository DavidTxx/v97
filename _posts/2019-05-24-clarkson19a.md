abstract: We give the first dimensionality reduction methods for the overconstrained
  Tukey regression problem. The Tukey loss function $\|y\|_M = \sum_i M(y_i)$ has
  $M(y_i) \approx |y_i|^p$ for residual errors $y_i$ smaller than a prescribed threshold
  $\tau$, but $M(y_i)$ becomes constant for errors $|y_i| > \tau$. Our results depend
  on a new structural result, proven constructively, showing that for any $d$-dimensional
  subspace $L \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, there is a fixed bounded-size subset of coordinates
  containing, for every $y \in L$, all the large coordinates, with respect to the
  Tukey loss function, of $y$. Our methods reduce a given Tukey regression problem
  to a smaller weighted version, whose solution is a provably good approximate solution
  to the original problem. Our reductions are fast, simple and easy to implement,
  and we give empirical results demonstrating their practicality, using existing heuristic
  solvers for the small versions. We also give exponential-time algorithms giving
  provably good solutions, and hardness results suggesting that a significant speedup
  in the worst case is unlikely.
