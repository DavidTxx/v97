abstract: We identify a new variational inference scheme for dynamical systems whose
  transition function is modelled by a Gaussian process. Inference in this setting
  has either employed computationally intensive MCMC methods, or relied on factorisations
  of the variational posterior. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the factorisation
  between latent system states and transition function can lead to a miscalibrated
  posterior and to learning unnecessarily large noise terms. We eliminate this factorisation
  by explicitly modelling the dependence between state trajectories and the low-rank
  representation of our Gaussian process posterior. Samples of the latent states can
  then be tractably generated by conditioning on this representation. The method we
  obtain gives better predictive performance and more calibrated estimates of the
  transition function, yet maintains the same time and space complexities as mean-field
  methods.
