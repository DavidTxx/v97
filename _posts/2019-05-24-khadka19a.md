abstract: Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied to
  a range of challenging control tasks. However, these methods typically struggle
  with achieving effective exploration and are extremely sensitive to the choice of
  hyperparameters. One reason is that most approaches use a noisy version of their
  operating policy to explore - thereby limiting the range of exploration. In this
  paper, we introduce Collaborative Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (CERL), a
  scalable framework that comprises a portfolio of policies that simultaneously explore
  and exploit diverse regions of the solution space. A collection of learners - typically
  proven algorithms like TD3 - optimize over varying time-horizons leading to this
  diverse portfolio. All learners contribute to and use a shared replay buffer to
  achieve greater sample efficiency. Computational resources are dynamically distributed
  to favor the best learners as a form of online algorithm selection. Neuroevolution
  binds this entire process to generate a single emergent learner that exceeds the
  capabilities of any individual learner. Experiments in a range of continuous control
  benchmarks demonstrate that the emergent learner significantly outperforms its composite
  learners while remaining overall more sample-efficient - notably solving the Mujoco
  Humanoid benchmark where all of its composite learners (TD3) fail entirely in isolation.
