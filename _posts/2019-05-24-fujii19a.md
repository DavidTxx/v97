abstract: We propose a new concept named adaptive submodularity ratio to study the
  greedy policy for sequential decision making. While the greedy policy is known to
  perform well for a wide variety of adaptive stochastic optimization problems in
  practice, its theoretical properties have been analyzed only for a limited class
  of problems. We narrow the gap between theory and practice by using adaptive submodularity
  ratio, which enables us to prove approximation guarantees of the greedy policy for
  a substantially wider class of problems. Examples of newly analyzed problems include
  important applications such as adaptive influence maximization and adaptive feature
  selection. Our adaptive submodularity ratio also provides bounds of adaptivity gaps.
  Experiments confirm that the greedy policy performs well with the applications being
  considered compared to standard heuristics.
