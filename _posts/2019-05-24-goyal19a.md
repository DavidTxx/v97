abstract: In this work, we develop a technique to produce counterfactual visual explanations.
  Given a ‘query’ image $I$ for which a vision system predicts class $c$, a counterfactual
  visual explanation identifies how $I$ could change such that the system would output
  a different specified class $c’$. To do this, we select a ‘distractor’ image $I’$
  that the system predicts as class $c’$ and identify spatial regions in $I$ and $I’$
  such that replacing the identified region in $I$ with the identified region in $I’$
  would push the system towards classifying $I$ as $c’$. We apply our approach to
  multiple image classification datasets generating qualitative results showcasing
  the interpretability and discriminativeness of our counterfactual explanations.
  To explore the effectiveness of our explanations in teaching humans, we present
  machine teaching experiments for the task of fine-grained bird classification. We
  find that users trained to distinguish bird species fare better when given access
  to counterfactual explanations in addition to training examples.
