abstract: Generative models often use latent variables to represent structured variation
  in high-dimensional data, such as images and medical waveforms. However, these latent
  variables may ignore subtle, yet meaningful features in the data. Some features
  may predict an outcome of interest (e.g. heart attack) but account for only a small
  fraction of variation in the data. We propose a generative model training objective
  that uses a black-box discriminative model as a regularizer to learn representations
  that preserve this predictive variation. With these discriminatively regularized
  latent variable models, we visualize and measure variation in the data that influence
  a black-box predictive model, enabling an expert to better understand each prediction.
  With this technique, we study models that use electrocardiograms to predict outcomes
  of clinical interest. We measure our approach on synthetic and real data with statistical
  summaries and an experiment carried out by a physician.
