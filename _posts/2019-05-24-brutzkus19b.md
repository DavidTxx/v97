abstract: Empirical evidence suggests that neural networks with ReLU activations generalize
  better with over-parameterization. However, there is currently no theoretical analysis
  that explains this observation. In this work, we provide theoretical and empirical
  evidence that, in certain cases, overparameterized convolutional networks generalize
  better than small networks because of an interplay between weight clustering and
  feature exploration at initialization. We demonstrate this theoretically for a 3-layer
  convolutional neural network with max-pooling, in a novel setting which extends
  the XOR problem. We show that this interplay implies that with overparamterization,
  gradient descent converges to global minima with better generalization performance
  compared to global minima of small networks. Empirically, we demonstrate these phenomena
  for a 3-layer convolutional neural network in the MNIST task.
