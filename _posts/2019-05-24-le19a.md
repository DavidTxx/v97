abstract: 'When learning policies for real-world domains, two important questions
  arise: (i) how to efficiently use pre-collected off-policy, non-optimal behavior
  data; and (ii) how to mediate among different competing objectives and constraints.
  We thus study the problem of batch policy learning under multiple constraints, and
  offer a systematic solution. We first propose a flexible meta-algorithm that admits
  any batch reinforcement learning and online learning procedure as subroutines. We
  then present a specific algorithmic instantiation and provide performance guarantees
  for the main objective and all constraints. As part of off-policy learning, we propose
  a simple method for off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) and derive PAC-style bounds.
  Our algorithm achieves strong empirical results in different domains, including
  in a challenging problem of simulated car driving subject to multiple constraints
  such as lane keeping and smooth driving. We also show experimentally that our OPE
  method outperforms other popular OPE techniques on a standalone basis, especially
  in a high-dimensional setting.'
