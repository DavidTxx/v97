abstract: 'We propose an intriguingly simple method for the construction of adversarial
  images in the black-box setting. In constrast to the white-box scenario, constructing
  black-box adversarial images has the additional constraint on query budget, and
  efficient attacks remain an open problem to date. With only the mild assumption
  of requiring continuous-valued confidence scores, our highly query-efficient algorithm
  utilizes the following simple iterative principle: we randomly sample a vector from
  a predefined orthonormal basis and either add or subtract it to the target image.
  Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can be used for both untargeted and
  targeted attacks â€“ resulting in previously unprecedented query efficiency in both
  settings. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithm on several
  real world settings including the Google Cloud Vision API. We argue that our proposed
  algorithm should serve as a strong baseline for future black-box attacks, in particular
  because it is extremely fast and its implementation requires less than 20 lines
  of PyTorch code.'
