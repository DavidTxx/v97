abstract: Human perception is structured around objects which form the basis for our
  higher-level cognition and impressive systematic generalization abilities. Yet most
  work on representation learning focuses on feature learning without even considering
  multiple objects, or treats segmentation as an (often supervised) preprocessing
  step. Instead, we argue for the importance of learning to segment and represent
  objects jointly. We demonstrate that, starting from the simple assumption that a
  scene is composed of multiple entities, it is possible to learn to segment images
  into interpretable objects with disentangled representations. Our method learns
  – without supervision – to inpaint occluded parts, and extrapolates to scenes with
  more objects and to unseen objects with novel feature combinations. We also show
  that, due to the use of iterative variational inference, our system is able to learn
  multi-modal posteriors for ambiguous inputs and extends naturally to sequences.
