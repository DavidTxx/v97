abstract: Natural-gradient methods enable fast and simple algorithms for variational
  inference, but due to computational difficulties, their use is mostly limited to
  minimal exponential-family (EF) approximations. In this paper, we extend their application
  to estimate structured approximations such as mixtures of EF distributions. Such
  approximations can fit complex, multimodal posterior distributions and are generally
  more accurate than unimodal EF approximations. By using a minimal conditional-EF
  representation of such approximations, we derive simple natural-gradient updates.
  Our empirical results demonstrate a faster convergence of our natural-gradient method
  compared to black-box gradient-based methods. Our work expands the scope of natural
  gradients for Bayesian inference and makes them more widely applicable than before.
