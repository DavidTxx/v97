abstract: Motivated by settings in which predictive models may be required to be non-discriminatory
  with respect to certain attributes (such as race), but even collecting the sensitive
  attribute may be forbidden or restricted, we initiate the study of fair learning
  under the constraint of differential privacy. Our first algorithm is a private implementation
  of the equalized odds post-processing approach of (Hardt et al., 2016). This algorithm
  is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly
  at test time, which can be viewed as a form of “disparate treatment”. Our second
  algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing
  approach of (Agarwal et al., 2018) which is more complex but need not have access
  to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness,
  accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and
  show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test
  time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation.
