abstract: We present a method for design problems wherein the goal is to maximize
  or specify the value of one or more properties of interest (e.g. maximizing the
  fluorescence of a protein). We assume access to black box, stochastic â€œoracle" predictive
  functions, each of which maps from design space to a distribution over properties
  of interest. Because many state-of-the-art predictive models are known to suffer
  from pathologies, especially for data far from the training distribution, the problem
  becomes different from directly optimizing the oracles. Herein, we propose a method
  to solve this problem that uses model-based adaptive sampling to estimate a distribution
  over the design space, conditioned on the desired properties.
