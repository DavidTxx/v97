abstract: We propose a novel procedure which adds "content-addressability" to any
  given unconditional implicit model e.g., a generative adversarial network (GAN).
  The procedure allows users to control the generative process by specifying a set
  (arbitrary size) of desired examples based on which similar samples are generated
  from the model. The proposed approach, based on kernel mean matching, is applicable
  to any generative models which transform latent vectors to samples, and does not
  require retraining of the model. Experiments on various high-dimensional image generation
  problems (CelebA-HQ, LSUN bedroom, bridge, tower) show that our approach is able
  to generate images which are consistent with the input set, while retaining the
  image quality of the original model. To our knowledge, this is the first work that
  attempts to construct, at test time, a content-addressable generative model from
  a trained marginal model.
