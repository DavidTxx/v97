abstract: Programming languages allow us to express complex predicates, but existing
  inference methods are unable to condition probabilistic models on most of them.
  To support a broader class of predicates, we develop an inference procedure called
  predicate exchange, which softens predicates. A soft predicate quantifies the extent
  to which values of model variables are consistent with its hard counterpart. We
  substitute the likelihood term in the Bayesian posterior with a soft predicate,
  and develop a variant of replica exchange MCMC to draw posterior samples. We implement
  predicate exchange as a language agnostic tool which performs a nonstandard execution
  of a probabilistic program. We demonstrate the approach on sequence models of health
  and inverse rendering.
