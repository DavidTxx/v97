abstract: Most modern text-to-speech architectures use a WaveNet vocoder for synthesizing
  high-fidelity waveform audio, but there have been limitations, such as high inference
  time, in practical applications due to its ancestral sampling scheme. The recently
  suggested Parallel WaveNet and ClariNet has achieved real-time audio synthesis capability
  by incorporating inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) for parallel sampling. However,
  these approaches require a two-stage training pipeline with a well-trained teacher
  network and can only produce natural sound by using probability distillation along
  with heavily-engineered auxiliary loss terms. We propose FloWaveNet, a flow-based
  generative model for raw audio synthesis. FloWaveNet requires only a single-stage
  training procedure and a single maximum likelihood loss, without any additional
  auxiliary terms, and it is inherently parallel due to the characteristics of generative
  flow. The model can efficiently sample raw audio in real-time, with clarity comparable
  to previous two-stage parallel models. The code and samples for all models, including
  our FloWaveNet, are available on GitHub.
