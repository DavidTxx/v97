abstract: "This paper considers Safe Policy Improvement (SPI) in Batch Reinforcement
  Learning (Batch RL): from a fixed dataset and without direct access to the true
  environment, train a policy that is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the
  baseline policy used to collect the data. \t Our approach, called SPI with Baseline
  Bootstrapping (SPIBB), is inspired by the knows-what-it-knows paradigm: it bootstraps
  the trained policy with the baseline when the uncertainty is high. \t Our first
  algorithm, $\\Pi_b$-SPIBB, comes with SPI theoretical guarantees. \t We also implement
  a variant, $\\Pi_{\\leq b}$-SPIBB, that is even more efficient in practice. \t We
  apply our algorithms to a motivational stochastic gridworld domain and further demonstrate
  on randomly generated MDPs the superiority of SPIBB with respect to existing algorithms,
  not only in safety but also in mean performance. \t Finally, we implement a model-free
  version of SPIBB and show its benefits on a navigation task with deep RL implementation
  called SPIBB-DQN, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first RL algorithm
  relying on a neural network representation able to train efficiently and reliably
  from batch data, without any interaction with the environment."
