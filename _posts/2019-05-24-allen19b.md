abstract: We propose infinite mixture prototypes to adaptively represent both simple
  and complex data distributions for few-shot learning. Infinite mixture prototypes
  combine deep representation learning with Bayesian nonparametrics, representing
  each class by a set of clusters, unlike existing prototypical methods that represent
  each class by a single cluster. By inferring the number of clusters, infinite mixture
  prototypes interpolate between nearest neighbor and prototypical representations
  in a learned feature space, which improves accuracy and robustness in the few-shot
  regime. We show the importance of adaptive capacity for capturing complex data distributions
  such as super-classes (like alphabets in character recognition), with 10-25% absolute
  accuracy improvements over prototypical networks, while still maintaining or improving
  accuracy on standard few-shot learning benchmarks. By clustering labeled and unlabeled
  data with the same rule, infinite mixture prototypes achieve state-of-the-art semi-supervised
  accuracy, and can perform purely unsupervised clustering, unlike existing fully-
  and semi-supervised prototypical methods.
