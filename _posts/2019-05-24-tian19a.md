abstract: The AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, and AlphaZero series of algorithms are remarkable
  demonstrations of deep reinforcement learningâ€™s capabilities, achieving superhuman
  performance in the complex game of Go with progressively increasing autonomy. However,
  many obstacles remain in the understanding of and usability of these promising approaches
  by the research community. Toward elucidating unresolved mysteries and facilitating
  future research, we propose ELF OpenGo, an open-source reimplementation of the AlphaZero
  algorithm. ELF OpenGo is the first open-source Go AI to convincingly demonstrate
  superhuman performance with a perfect (20:0) record against global top professionals.
  We apply ELF OpenGo to conduct extensive ablation studies, and to identify and analyze
  numerous interesting phenomena in both the model training and in the gameplay inference
  procedures. Our code, models, selfplay datasets, and auxiliary data are publicly
  available.
