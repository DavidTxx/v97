abstract: Nowadays, many problems require learning a model from data owned by different
  participants who are restricted to share their examples due to privacy concerns,
  which is referred to as multiparty learning in the literature. In conventional multiparty
  learning, a global model is usually trained from scratch via a communication protocol,
  ignoring the fact that each party may already have a local model trained on her
  own dataset. In this paper, we define a multiparty multiclass margin to measure
  the global behavior of a set of heterogeneous local models, and propose a general
  learning method called HMR (Heterogeneous Model Reuse) to optimize the margin. Our
  method reuses local models to approximate a global model, even when data are non-i.i.d
  distributed among parties, by exchanging few examples under predefined budget. Experiments
  on synthetic and real-world data covering different multiparty scenarios show the
  effectiveness of our proposal.
