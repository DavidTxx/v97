abstract: We present a particle flow realization of Bayes’ rule, where an ODE-based
  neural operator is used to transport particles from a prior to its posterior after
  a new observation. We prove that such an ODE operator exists. Its neural parameterization
  can be trained in a meta-learning framework, allowing this operator to reason about
  the effect of an individual observation on the posterior, and thus generalize across
  different priors, observations and to sequential Bayesian inference. We demonstrated
  the generalization ability of our particle flow Bayes operator in several canonical
  and high dimensional examples.
