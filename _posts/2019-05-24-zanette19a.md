abstract: Strong worst-case performance bounds for episodic reinforcement learning
  exist but fortunately in practice RL algorithms perform much better than such bounds
  would predict. Algorithms and theory that provide strong problem-dependent bounds
  could help illuminate the key features of what makes a RL problem hard and reduce
  the barrier to using RL algorithms in practice. As a step towards this we derive
  an algorithm and analysis for finite horizon discrete MDPs with state-of-the-art
  worst-case regret bounds and substantially tighter bounds if the RL environment
  has special features but without apriori knowledge of the environment from the algorithm.
  As a result of our analysis, we also help address an open learning theory questionÂ \cite{jiang2018open}
  about episodic MDPs with a constant upper-bound on the sum of rewards, providing
  a regret bound function of the number of episodes with no dependence on the horizon.
