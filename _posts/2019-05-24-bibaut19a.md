abstract: We study the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in Reinforcement Learning
  (RL), where the aim is to estimate the performance of a new policy given historical
  data that may have been generated by a different policy, or policies. In particular,
  we introduce a novel doubly-robust estimator for the OPE problem in RL, based on
  the Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation principle from the statistical causal
  inference literature. We also introduce several variance reduction techniques that
  lead to impressive performance gains in off-policy evaluation. We show empirically
  that our estimator uniformly wins over existing off-policy evaluation methods across
  multiple RL environments and various levels of model misspecification. Finally,
  we further the existing theoretical analysis of estimators for the RL off-policy
  estimation problem by showing their $O_P(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate of convergence and characterizing
  their asymptotic distribution.
