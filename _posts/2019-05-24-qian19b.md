abstract: We propose a general yet simple theorem describing the convergence of SGD
  under the arbitrary sampling paradigm. Our theorem describes the convergence of
  an infinite array of variants of SGD, each of which is associated with a specific
  probability law governing the data selection rule used to form minibatches. This
  is the first time such an analysis is performed, and most of our variants of SGD
  were never explicitly considered in the literature before. Our analysis relies on
  the recently introduced notion of expected smoothness and does not rely on a uniform
  bound on the variance of the stochastic gradients. By specializing our theorem to
  different mini-batching strategies, such as sampling with replacement and independent
  sampling, we derive exact expressions for the stepsize as a function of the mini-batch
  size. With this we can also determine the mini-batch size that optimizes the total
  complexity, and show explicitly that as the variance of the stochastic gradient
  evaluated at the minimum grows, so does the optimal mini-batch size. For zero variance,
  the optimal mini-batch size is one. Moreover, we prove insightful stepsize-switching
  rules which describe when one should switch from a constant to a decreasing stepsize
  regime.
