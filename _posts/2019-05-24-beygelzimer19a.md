abstract: 'We study the problem of efficient online multiclass linear classification
  with bandit feedback, where all examples belong to one of $K$ classes and lie in
  the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Previous works have left open the challenge
  of designing efficient algorithms with finite mistake bounds when the data is linearly
  separable by a margin $\gamma$. In this work, we take a first step towards this
  problem. We consider two notions of linear separability: strong and weak. 1. Under
  the strong linear separability condition, we design an efficient algorithm that
  achieves a near-optimal mistake bound of $O\left(\frac{K}{\gamma^2} \right)$. 2.
  Under the more challenging weak linear separability condition, we design an efficient
  algorithm with a mistake bound of $2^{\widetilde{O}(\min(K \log^2 \frac{1}{\gamma},
  \sqrt{\frac{1}{\gamma}} \log K))}$. Our algorithm is based on kernel Perceptron,
  which is inspired by the work of Klivans & Servedio (2008) on improperly learning
  intersection of halfspaces.'
