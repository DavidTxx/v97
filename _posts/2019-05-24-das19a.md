abstract: We propose a targeted communication architecture for multi-agent reinforcement
  learning, where agents learn both <em>what</em> messages to send and <em>whom</em>
  to address them to while performing cooperative tasks in partially-observable environments.
  This targeting behavior is learnt solely from downstream task-specific reward without
  any communication supervision. We additionally augment this with a multi-round communication
  approach where agents coordinate via multiple rounds of communication before taking
  actions in the environment. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of cooperative
  multi-agent tasks, of varying difficulties, with varying number of agents, in a
  variety of environments ranging from 2D grid layouts of shapes and simulated traffic
  junctions to 3D indoor environments, and demonstrate the benefits of targeted and
  multi-round communication. Moreover, we show that the targeted communication strategies
  learned by agents are interpretable and intuitive. Finally, we show that our architecture
  can be easily extended to mixed and competitive environments, leading to improved
  performance and sample complexity over recent state-of-the-art approaches.
