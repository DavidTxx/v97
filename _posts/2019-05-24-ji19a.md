abstract: Two types of zeroth-order stochastic algorithms have recently been designed
  for nonconvex optimization respectively based on the first-order techniques SVRG
  and SARAH/SPIDER. This paper addresses several important issues that are still open
  in these methods. First, all existing SVRG-type zeroth-order algorithms suffer from
  worse function query complexities than either zeroth-order gradient descent (ZO-GD)
  or stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
  ZO-SVRG-Coord-Rand and develop a new analysis for an existing ZO-SVRG-Coord algorithm
  proposed in Liu et al. 2018b, and show that both ZO-SVRG-Coord-Rand and ZO-SVRG-Coord
  (under our new analysis) outperform other exiting SVRG-type zeroth-order methods
  as well as ZO-GD and ZO-SGD. Second, the existing SPIDER-type algorithm SPIDER-SZO
  (Fang et al., 2018) has superior theoretical performance, but suffers from the generation
  of a large number of Gaussian random variables as well as a $\sqrt{\epsilon}$-level
  stepsize in practice. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm ZO-SPIDER-Coord,
  which is free from Gaussian variable generation and allows a large constant stepsize
  while maintaining the same convergence rate and query complexity, and we further
  show that ZO-SPIDER-Coord automatically achieves a linear convergence rate as the
  iterate enters into a local PL region without restart and algorithmic modification.
