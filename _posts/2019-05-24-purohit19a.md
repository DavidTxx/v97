abstract: In this paper we introduce the hiring under uncertainty problem to model
  the questions faced by hiring committees in large enterprises and universities alike.
  Given a set of $n$ eligible candidates, the decision maker needs to choose the sequence
  of candidates to make offers so as to hire the $k$ best candidates. However, candidates
  may choose to reject an offer (for instance, due to a competing offer) and the decision
  maker has a time limit by which all positions must be filled. Given an estimate
  of the probabilities of acceptance for each candidate, the hiring under uncertainty
  problem is to design a strategy of making offers so that the total expected value
  of all candidates hired by the time limit is maximized. We provide a 2-approximation
  algorithm for the setting where offers must be made in sequence, an 8-approximation
  when offers may be made in parallel, and a 10-approximation for the more general
  stochastic knapsack setting with finite probes.
