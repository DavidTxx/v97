abstract: We propose a novel framework PROVEN to \textbf{PRO}babilistically \textbf{VE}rify
  \textbf{N}eural networkâ€™s robustness with statistical guarantees. PROVEN provides
  probability certificates of neural network robustness when the input perturbation
  follow distributional characterization. Notably, PROVEN is derived from current
  state-of-the-art worst-case neural network robustness verification frameworks, and
  therefore it can provide probability certificates with little computational overhead
  on top of existing methods such as Fast-Lin, CROWN and CNN-Cert. Experiments on
  small and large MNIST and CIFAR neural network models demonstrate our probabilistic
  approach can tighten up robustness certificate to around $1.8 \times$ and $3.5 \times$
  with at least a $99.99%$ confidence compared with the worst-case robustness certificate
  by CROWN and CNN-Cert.
