abstract: By enabling correct differentiation in Stochastic Computation Graphs (SCGs),
  the infinitely differentiable Monte-Carlo estimator (DiCE) can generate correct
  estimates for the higher order gradients that arise in, e.g., multi-agent reinforcement
  learning and meta-learning. However, the baseline term in DiCE that serves as a
  control variate for reducing variance applies only to first order gradient estimation,
  limiting the utility of higher-order gradient estimates. To improve the sample efficiency
  of DiCE, we propose a new baseline term for higher order gradient estimation. This
  term may be easily included in the objective, and produces unbiased variance-reduced
  estimators under (automatic) differentiation, without affecting the estimate of
  the objective itself or of the first order gradient estimate. It reuses the same
  baseline function (e.g., the state-value function in reinforcement learning) already
  used for the first order baseline. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical
  evaluations of this new baseline, which demonstrate that it can dramatically reduce
  the variance of DiCE’s second order gradient estimators and also show empirically
  that it reduces the variance of third and fourth order gradients. This computational
  tool can be easily used to estimate higher order gradients with unprecedented efficiency
  and simplicity wherever automatic differentiation is utilised, and it has the potential
  to unlock applications of higher order gradients in reinforcement learning and meta-learning.
