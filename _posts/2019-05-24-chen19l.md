abstract: A broad range of cross-$m$-domain generation researches boil down to matching
  a joint distribution by deep generative models (DGMs). Hitherto algorithms excel
  in pairwise domains while as $m$ increases, remain struggling to scale themselves
  to ﬁt a joint distribution. In this paper, we propose a domain-scalable DGM, i.e.,
  MMI-ALI for $m$-domain joint distribution matching. As an $m$-domain ensemble model
  of ALIs (Dumoulin et al., 2016), MMI-ALI is adversarially trained with maximizing
  Multivariate Mutual Information (MMI) w.r.t. joint variables of each pair of domains
  and their shared feature. The negative MMIs are upper bounded by a series of feasible
  losses provably leading to matching $m$-domain joint distributions. MMI-ALI linearly
  scales as $m$ increases and thus, strikes a right balance between efﬁcacy and scalability.
  We evaluate MMI-ALI in diverse challenging $m$-domain scenarios and verify its superiority.
